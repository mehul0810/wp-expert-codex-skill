# Project Subagent Routing Discipline

Use this for WordPress project subagents, custom project agents, and model/reasoning allocation. Keep routing at project/runtime level; do not use global hooks or permanent model IDs to simulate dynamic selection.

## Goal

Reduce wall time and token cost without weakening evidence. The parent owns strategy, boundaries, final decisions, validation synthesis, commits, pushes, and PRs. Subagents own bounded mapping, review, evidence, or narrow implementation.

## Delegation Gate

Use subagents when parallel mapping saves time, independent plugin/theme/test/docs/security lanes exist, a second review materially reduces risk, or browser/CI evidence can be gathered independently.

Do not delegate small obvious edits, work without acceptance criteria, broad mutation without a bounded handoff, or attempts to bypass trust, sandbox, approval, or review controls.

## Availability-First Routing Contract

At each delegation, before assigning or overriding a model or reasoning level:

1. Re-check the model/reasoning combinations exposed by the active host or tool; do not rely on an earlier inventory.
2. Treat an owner-named model/reasoning combination as a preference: use it when available and suitable, not as a permanent runtime requirement.
3. Classify ambiguity, implementation completeness, risk, reversibility, evidence burden, context size, and latency/cost need.
4. Select the lowest sufficient available capability tier and supported reasoning level.
5. Omit overrides when inherited model/reasoning already fits.

Never assume a model ID or that `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or another reasoning label exists. Capability-check both fields at runtime.

### Owner Capacity Signal

On the owner's first CTO interaction of their local calendar day, ask once: `Should I plan delegated work around conservative capacity, or do you expect to use available capacity today or this week?`

- Do not block work or repeat the question that day. Missing or unclear answers mean conservative capacity: start with one delegated worker at a time.
- Never claim visibility into, control over, or a guarantee of account quota, reset timing, or future capacity.
- Use the answer only after task risk and runtime availability are classified: choose the lowest sufficient tier, reasoning, concurrency, and duration. Capacity never lowers a risk tier or expands authority.
- Reserve optional higher-cost or long-running parallel work for stated capacity; high-risk work still receives the strongest suitable lane even under conservative capacity.
- Keep the signal in the current CTO control context. Do not create a recurring automation or durable account-usage record unless the owner explicitly requests it.

### Capability Tiers

- Fast/economical: routine mapping, issue intake, deterministic docs/tests, evidence capture, simple CI triage, and screenshot capture when product behavior does not change.
- Balanced implementation: the default for bounded product/code changes, ordinary PR review, CI repair, or moderate integration reasoning.
- Strongest suitable reasoning-capable: ambiguous architecture, security/privacy, migrations, public contracts, high-scale performance, release blockers/decisions, cross-product conflicts, and final high-risk review.

When the current host exposes the 5.6 capability family, map its runtime classes after inventory:

- Luna-class: monitoring, read-only mapping, deterministic evidence, screenshots, narrow docs/tests, and simple CI triage; use `low`, or `medium` when synthesis needs it.
- Terra-class: default PO execution, bounded implementation, ordinary PR review, CI repair, integration work, and evidence synthesis; use `medium`, or `high` for ambiguous integration.
- Sol-class: release readiness, critical/release PR review, security/privacy, architecture, migrations, public contracts, major regressions, cross-product conflicts, topology recovery, and ambiguous owner decisions; use `high` or `xhigh` when supported.

These are current capability-class aliases, not permanent model IDs or reusable configuration values. If the host exposes different names, preserve the same risk/cost tiers. Use reasoning above `xhigh` only when the owner explicitly requests it or concrete failed proof shows `xhigh` is insufficient.

Allocation changes capability, not authority. A Sol-class assignment for topology recovery or release judgment still inherits protected-thread, mutation, and owner-approval gates from the governing role.

For final high-risk review, keep the strongest suitable lane as reviewer. Do not downgrade the final reviewer merely for model diversity; add an independent second pass only when variance reduction materially justifies its cost.

Portfolio sweeps normally use low/medium reasoning; escalate for cross-product conflicts, protected-thread recovery, or owner decision briefs. Product heartbeats normally use medium; escalate for release-ready synthesis, ambiguous scope, risky merge/release judgment, migrations, or topology drift. Keep screenshot capture and bounded official-source research on a fast tier unless judgment is complex.

### Escalation And De-Escalation

Escalate only after concrete ambiguity, failed proof, inadequate implementation, or confirmed risk exceeds the current tier. Do not brute-force retries with an underpowered lane. De-escalate after planning, exact-file mapping, acceptance criteria, or deterministic validation removes uncertainty.

Classify repeated retries or weak evidence caused by the assigned lane as `wrong model/reasoning allocation`, then reassess availability and tier.

If the preferred/configured combination is unavailable, reassess it against the live inventory. Preserve the task-required risk tier first, then choose the nearest available class in that tier and its highest sufficient supported reasoning. Never downgrade a high-risk decision to preserve a model name or reasoning label. Cross tiers only when no same-tier class can produce the evidence. A fast/economical preference should use the nearest available fast/economical class, not automatically the strongest model. Keep capability-equivalent substitutions quiet; report only a meaningful capability, evidence, latency, cost, or risk change:

```text
Requested: <model/reasoning>
Available constraint: <missing model or unsupported reasoning>
Fallback: <selected capability tier and supported reasoning>
Impact: <none or evidence/risk difference>
```

If the strongest available fallback cannot meet the evidence or reliability required for a high-risk final recommendation, fail closed: return the capability/proof gap and withhold that recommendation. A weaker fallback may map evidence or prepare options, but it must not present the gated judgment as complete.

## Planning Before Allocation

Front-load scope into the issue and delegation prompt so execution does not spend tokens rediscovering the plan:

- exact repo/path and issue,
- branch/base and allowed files,
- acceptance criteria and non-goals,
- validation and screenshot/live-proof needs,
- risks, hard gates, output format, and stop condition.

Fully planned bounded work should use the lowest sufficient tier. Incomplete or decision-shaping work stays with the parent or moves to the strongest suitable tier before implementation.

## Skill Routing

Assign one lane and the narrowest skill/reference:

- Plugin: `$wp-plugin-expert` plus one plugin reference.
- Theme/FSE: `$wp-theme-expert` plus one theme reference.
- Site/UX/search: `$wp-site-expert` plus one site reference.
- Contribution: `$wp-contributor` plus the Core, Gutenberg, or Meta reference.
- Design: `design-intelligence-routing.md`, then the narrow Product Design capability.
- Portfolio: `$wp-portfolio-cto`; product execution remains in PO/worker lanes.
- Product workflow: `$wp-product-orchestrator`; implementation routes to a specialist.
- Content/growth: `content-writer`, `seo-positioning-optimizer`, or `$wp-site-expert` by artifact.

Subagent prompt contract:

```text
Use only the named skill/reference lane unless a concrete blocker appears.
Inspect the exact artifact first. Stay inside scope and do not subdelegate.
Return findings, files touched/inspected, confidence, validation, risks, and adjacent findings.
Convert Product Design feedback into acceptance criteria, design QA checks, or adjacent findings.
If blocked, report recovery attempted and the exact proof gap.
Do not modify files unless assigned as a narrow fixer.
Keep output within the requested limit.
```

## Reusable Project Profiles

Reusable `.codex/agents/*.toml` templates must not pin transient model IDs or reasoning labels. Omit those fields and inherit the parent by default. If a project needs explicit allocation, materialize the fields at runtime from the verified availability inventory rather than committing a stale ID.

Read-only mapper:

```toml
name = "wp-mapper"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = "Use the named specialist and one reference. Map entry points, tests, and risks in at most 20 bullets. Do not edit files."
```

Narrow fixer:

```toml
name = "wp-narrow-fixer"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
developer_instructions = "Use supplied files, acceptance checks, and validation. Make the smallest safe change. Do not broaden scope or commit."
```

Reviewer:

```toml
name = "wp-pr-reviewer"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = "Review changed files only. Findings first with severity, file/line, impact, and missing tests. Do not edit files."
```

## Project Configuration

Keep concurrency conservative and reduce it further when the capacity signal is missing or conservative:

```toml
[agents]
max_threads = 3
max_depth = 1
```

Raise concurrency only after the workflow is proven. Keep depth at one unless the repo deliberately supports nested review.

## Hooks Boundary

Use hooks for deterministic project lifecycle checks such as generated artifacts, formatting, explicit PR base, or validation metadata. Do not use hooks for expertise selection, broad research, or dynamic model assignment.

## Parent Checklist

Before delegation: verify availability, choose the capability tier, front-load the plan, set one lane/output budget, prefer read-only unless exact fixing is assigned, and avoid duplicate exploration.

Keep payloads compact: do not batch broad parallel thread reads, full PR diffs, oversized issue bodies, or accumulated automation history. Create issues one at a time with concise bodies after narrow duplicate-screening.

After return: merge findings rather than transcripts, verify high-risk claims, reassess whether escalation/de-escalation is warranted, and keep commits/PRs parent-owned.
