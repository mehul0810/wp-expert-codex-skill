# Heartbeat Check-In Discipline

Use this reference for CTO and PO heartbeat reporting. Check-ins must be delta-first, decision-oriented, owner-readable, and brief enough to explain change without repeating unchanged state.

## Core Rules

- Lead with change. Start from what changed since the last check-in, not from a full restatement.
- Separate signal by ownership: blocked, owner-needed, Codex-owned, and quiet.
- Write for owner consumption: owner-readable, not as a raw tool log, XML payload, or verification dump.
- Treat repeated blockers as escalation material. Do not silently restate the same blocker heartbeat after heartbeat.
- Justify quiet status with evidence, not absence of effort.
- Use `NOTIFY` only when there is a material change, blocker, owner decision, executable work, release/proof drift, topology/process concern, or cadence change worth surfacing.
- Use `DONT_NOTIFY` only when no owner decision, blocker, executable work, material drift, or process concern exists.
- Prefer plain decision language over workflow jargon. Replace vague terms like `owner-gated` with the exact decision needed.
- Heartbeats must exit cleanly. If a routine product heartbeat cannot finish current live checks quickly, return a partial owner-readable result instead of staying in progress.

## Readability Rules

- Use plain English section titles and short sentences.
- Avoid long SHAs, raw API/XML shapes, or dense verification clauses unless identity proof is the point.
- Put raw proof details only under `Evidence`, and keep them compact.
- Translate status into owner meaning: what changed, what is blocked, what needs a decision, and what Codex will do next.
- If a checkout is dirty/stale, say whether it blocks current work and what would unblock it.
- Do not paste long heartbeat XML, PR bodies, diffs, screenshot lists, or raw tool output into follow-up prompts. Also do not paste full skill bodies or repeated history into follow-up prompts. Use URLs, short deltas, and exact blocker summaries.

## `DONT_NOTIFY` Rule

`DONT_NOTIFY` is valid only when all of the following are true:

- No new blocker or repeated blocker escalation.
- No owner decision is needed now.
- No executable `owner:codex` work is being skipped.
- No material release, PR, CI, topology, automation, or process drift exists.
- Quiet/no-action status is backed by current evidence.

The `DONT_NOTIFY` message must be one sentence with the product name, strongest quiet reason, and whether any owner decision exists.

## `NOTIFY` Structure

Every `NOTIFY` check-in should separate these sections:

```text
What changed
What is blocked
What owner needs to decide
What Codex will do next
Evidence
Quiet products with evidence
Cadence/automation changes
```

## Partial Result Rule

Use a partial `NOTIFY` result for routine product heartbeats, quiet monitoring loops, or post-intervention checks when live checks time out, public checks run long, or one narrow verification path cannot finish promptly.

- Do not leave the heartbeat in progress for hours waiting on routine live checks.
- Return what is already verified.
- Name the exact blocked or incomplete checks.
- State whether owner decisions changed or stayed unchanged.
- State the next retry point or cadence adjustment.
- Keep the message owner-readable; do not dump retry logs.
- If a connector returns `Bad Request`, retry once with a strictly smaller payload and report the payload-reduction rule instead of repeating the same call shape. If the retry fails, stop broad reads, do not paste more context, and switch to one narrow source-of-truth check or a fresh worker/product thread.

Use this shape:

```text
NOTIFY - <product>

What changed
- <verified delta or no verified material change>.

What is blocked
- <exact timed-out or incomplete checks>; impact on confidence.

What owner needs to decide
- <changed decision or no change>.

What Codex will do next
- <retry scope, reduced cadence, or next safe action>.

Evidence
- <verified evidence already gathered>.

Cadence/automation changes
- <next retry window, reduced cadence, or pause reason>.
```

## Thread Health And Drift

Treat these as topology/process drift, not quiet status:

- empty completed turns,
- active turns with no material output,
- `systemError` thread state,
- worker non-materialization,
- wrong path/base execution,
- claimed issue/PR execution without proof,
- wrong model/reasoning lane causing retries or weak evidence,
- repeated quiet status while executable work exists.

For release blockers, one non-material PO heartbeat is enough to escalate.

Corrective action must be explicit: recover the worker/path, narrow the blocker, reduce/pause cadence, route a bounded worker, or escalate owner approval for protected-thread recovery.

## Portfolio CTO Template

Use exception reporting plus a compact coverage line for quiet products. Do not repeat a long full-product list unless it materially helps. Translate PO outputs into owner-facing portfolio language instead of copying raw PO XML/messages.

```text
NOTIFY

Material changes
- <product>: <what changed since last check-in>; impact.

Blocked
- <product>: <exact blocker>; why it still blocks; escalation status.

Owner decisions
- <product>: <exact decision needed>; recommendation; why now.

Codex-owned next actions
- <product>: <next executable action Codex can take without owner input>.

PO active work/delegations
- <product>: objective; active PR/issues; worker/delegation state.

Community queues
- <product>: human contributor PRs, human-created issues, bot/dependency PRs, and owner/automation-created issues; only mention material deltas or blockers.

Quiet products with evidence
- Verified quiet: <product list> - <compact reason such as no new PR/issue/CI/release/label drift>.

Cadence/automation changes
- <heartbeat/product>: <reduced, increased, paused, resumed, or topology follow-up>; why.
```

Escalate repeated blockers. For stale topology, surface the exact decision until resolved or cadence changes. Repeated quiet status should trigger cadence reduction/pause or a proactive discovery lane.

## CTO Intervention Trigger

CTO must not merely relay PO output. If a PO report is unclear, log-like, contradictory, passive, repeated, stalled, missing an expected action, or misaligned with the owner-approved objective, intervene immediately: ask why it is happening, what the blocker is, and what will change before the next heartbeat.

Trigger intervention without owner prompting when any of these happen:

- The same quiet state appears twice while active work or a release train still exists.
- A release blocker gets one non-material heartbeat.
- The PO says ready but does not execute an approved beta or non-production action.
- The thread stays in progress/stale without material output.
- The PO or worker ends with an empty completed turn or `systemError`.
- The PO reports raw logs instead of owner-readable decisions.
- Evidence-backed findings do not become issues.
- Unexpected behavior, maintainability debt, weak non-obvious comments, missing test coverage, repeated validation/tooling surprises, or workflow friction are reported without creating or linking a focused issue.
- Open human contributor PRs or new human-created issues are ignored in quiet-state reporting.
- A UI/user-workflow PR is treated as ready without Playground or equivalent visual/browser proof.
- Executable non-hard-gated work is deferred as an owner decision without explicit approval needed.
- Heartbeat cadence no longer matches product urgency.
- Issue/PR work is reported without proof, or the worker used the wrong path/base/model lane.

CTO response should be one of: correct the PO, reduce/pause cadence, request the exact blocker, recover/fork the product thread with owner approval when needed, or route a skill/process patch.

Portfolio 'NOTIFY' check-ins should include 'CTO intervention' when this happens so the owner sees what was corrected and why.

## Product PO Template

```text
NOTIFY - <product>

What changed
- <plain delta since last report>.

What is blocked
- <exact blocker>; does it block current work; what would unblock it.

What owner needs to decide
- <explicit decision wording such as waiting for approval to release 1.0.4 or waiting for next milestone scope>.

What Codex will do next
- <single next action Codex can take without owner input>.

Current objective
- <active release/train objective or bounded goal>.

Active PR/issues
- <release PRs>; <human contributor PR queue>; <bot/dependency PR queue>; <owner-created issues>; <human-created issue queue>; <automation-created issues>.

Evidence
- <compact CI/proof/package/research evidence or exact proof gap>.

Next action
- <single highest-leverage next action>.

Stop condition
- <what would make this thread quiet or require escalation>.
```

## Quiet Evidence

Quiet/no-action claims cite the best evidence:

- no new PR/issue/CI/release delta,
- no executable `owner:codex` item,
- only already-known explicit owner decisions remain,
- no new topology/worktree/automation drift,
- no release-readiness regression since the last report.

Avoid phrases like `no update`, `nothing new`, or `still monitoring` without evidence.

## Repetition Control

- If the same blocker repeats, say what was attempted, what changed, and what exact escalation remains.
- If nothing changed, compress to one quiet sentence instead of repeating the full structure.
- If a product consumed most of the action budget, summarize the rest with a compact verified-quiet coverage line.
- If a heartbeat timed out or exited partially, the next check-in should say what was verified before timeout, what remains unverified, and whether cadence was reduced or kept for a concrete reason.
