# Self-Improvement Loop

Use this reference when the owner flags that something was done wrong, a delegated thread drifted, or the orchestrator identifies a repeatable process failure.

## Self-Improvement Loop

When a mistake is identified:

1. Stop and classify the failure.
2. Correct immediate local state if safe.
3. Identify the missing rule or gate.
4. Decide where the learning belongs.
5. Decide the stale-learning lifecycle outcome.
6. Add or update behavior audit coverage when the mistake is repeatable.
7. Do not leave important workflow lessons only in chat memory.

## Learning Placement

Place durable lessons where they can be enforced:

- `wp-product-orchestrator` skill: cross-product orchestration behavior.
- Shared reference: reusable protocol across skills or products.
- Repo `AGENTS.md`: repo-specific agent workflow, branch rules, validation gates.
- Repo `PRODUCT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, or `RELEASE.md`: product truth, roadmap intent, release process.
- ADR: material architecture or product decision.
- GitHub issue: actionable product/engineering work.
- Automation memory: recurring audit/check-in learning that should be reused by automation.

## Stale Learning Lifecycle

When a prior learning, prompt line, memory note, repo-doc rule, or skill rule looks outdated, classify it before creating a new durable artifact:

- `Add`: new cross-project rule is missing and supported by repeated evidence.
- `Correct`: rule is still valid but needs a narrower source, base branch, validation gate, or wording.
- `Retire`: rule is obsolete, harmful, or contradicted by current source-of-truth evidence.
- `Supersede`: older memory or guidance remains historical but a newer repo doc, PR, issue, or skill rule is now authoritative.
- `Keep Watching`: evidence is suggestive but not strong enough for durable guidance.
- `Ignore`: one-off, project-specific, noisy, sensitive, or already handled elsewhere.

End every stale-learning audit item with an explicit outcome:

- `Fixed now`: corrected in the current run.
- `PR opened`: durable change proposed and linked.
- `Supersede note created`: old memory/guidance marked historical.
- `Detected only`: stale item found but current job cannot safely modify it.
- `Blocked`: exact access, dirty-worktree, branch/base, or owner-decision blocker.
- `Deferred`: evidence is real but another tracked issue/PR/thread owns the fix.

## Durable Artifact Dedupe

Before creating a memory note, repo-doc PR, skill PR, or workflow prompt update, check:

- Target note or existing supersede note.
- Target repo docs and current policy branch.
- Normalized rule slug or distinctive phrase.
- Open PRs and issues.
- Recently merged PRs and closed issues.
- Local branches that may contain unpublished docs work.
- Automation memory for same-day rollups or already-classified stale findings.

If a merged repo-doc PR already owns the behavior, report the older note as superseded or fixed instead of opening another PR. If a local checkout disagrees with live PR or branch evidence, fetch or treat live GitHub state as authoritative before concluding that docs are missing.

For recurring audits, keep one compact rollup per date and replace the current day block instead of appending duplicate same-day summaries.

## Failure Classification

Use concrete labels:

- Source-of-truth drift.
- Missing GitHub issue-first intake.
- Missing branch/base proof.
- Delegation before strategy.
- Missing delegation after strategy.
- Delegation unavailable without tool discovery.
- Wrong app-managed worktree root or base.
- Blanket blocker from due date, release branch, or dirty primary checkout.
- Portfolio coverage drift.
- Portfolio execution drift.
- Product thread topology drift.
- Scope creep or over-engineering.
- Missing owner approval.
- Release train violation.
- Missing validation or live proof.
- Missing GitHub communication.
- Token waste from loading irrelevant references.
- Duplicate durable artifact.
- Stale local-ref conclusion.
- Unclassified stale learning.
