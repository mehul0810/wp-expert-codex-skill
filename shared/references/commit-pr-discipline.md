# Commit And PR Discipline

Use this reference before committing, pushing, opening a PR, updating a PR body, or handing off product work.

## Branch Discipline

- Product repositories keep `main` as production release space and must not receive development work directly.
- Owner-managed `agent-*` control-plane repositories are the exception: validated changes commit and push directly to `main` by default. Do not create a feature branch or PR unless the owner explicitly asks for review or repository protection requires that path.
- `develop` is for unmilestoned development integration or as the verified source for creating missing milestone branches.
- Milestone-based work must create or use `release/<release-version>` branches from the verified development base and target issue PRs into that release branch. `<release-version>` is the version/milestone title, not the GitHub milestone ID or sequence number; do not create `release/3` unless the documented release version is literally `3`.
- Release branches merge to `main` only after explicit owner release approval.
- Production release approval must identify the exact release PR and candidate SHA. Merge that PR into `main` before creating the stable tag/release, then tag the verified production SHA; never release from `release/*` and reconcile `main` afterward.
- Never rely on GitHub's default base; prove and set the PR base explicitly.
- If a wrong milestone-ID branch was created, preserve commits by replaying or reconciling them into the correct release-version branch, retarget open PRs, and do not delete the wrong branch without explicit owner approval.

## Commit Convention

Use this commit format:

```text
type(scope): concise action
```

Examples:

- `feat(mcp): add internal link audit tool`
- `fix(oauth): harden redirect validation`
- `docs(release): clarify beta train gates`
- `test(content): cover internal link audit filters`
- `chore(ci): tighten package validation`

Rules:

- Keep commits scoped.
- Do not mix unrelated issues.
- Reference issue numbers in the PR body, not necessarily every commit subject.
- Commit only intended files.
- Avoid generated noise unless required.
- Do not push unless repo policy or the parent CTO thread authorizes it.
- Do not push to `main` for development work.

## PR Requirements

Every PR must include:

- Linked issue and milestone.
- Base branch evidence.
- Strategy summary.
- Scope.
- Non-goals / intentionally excluded work.
- Files changed.
- Validation commands and results.
- Live proof or proof gap.
- Screenshot evidence for admin, editor, frontend, style, layout, UX, or other design-visible changes, or an explicit reason screenshots could not be captured.
- Risk and rollback notes.
- Release impact.
- Delegated thread/worktree reference when applicable.
- Owner decisions needed, if any.

PRs must not:

- Rely on GitHub's default base.
- Target `main` for development or milestone work.
- Close issues accidentally when targeting a branch that will not auto-close them.
- Claim release readiness without release-train verification.
- Omit screenshot evidence when the PR changes design-visible output unless the proof gap is explicit.
- Merge themselves unless explicitly authorized.

Use closing keywords only when the PR fully resolves the linked issue and targets a branch where closure behavior is intended.

## Non-Production Merge Rule

Product orchestrators may review and merge scoped, non-draft, green PRs into `develop` or `release/<release-version>` when the base is correct, validation is current, and no explicit current owner stop exists on that exact PR. If branch protection, review rules, permissions, or tooling blocks the merge, report the exact blocker instead of treating it as an owner decision.

## Worker PR Rule

Every issue implementation should be done by a worker using the narrowest relevant WordPress specialist skill (`wp-plugin-expert`, `wp-theme-expert`, `wp-site-expert`, `wp-contributor`, or `content-writer`; `wp-expert` only if ambiguous), a Codex-created worktree, one issue, one branch, and one PR. Workers must not perform release actions, push directly to `main`, close issues, merge PRs, retarget milestones, or subdelegate.
