# Repo Product Docs Contract

Use this reference when a managed product repo lacks durable product, workflow, roadmap, release, or architecture truth.

## Product Truth Does Not Live Only In The Skill

The skill provides reusable orchestration behavior. Product-specific truth belongs in the product repo or GitHub.

Recommended repo docs:

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-specific agent workflow, branch rules, validation gates, PR rules, and automation constraints.
- `PRODUCT.md`: product positioning, target users/customers, product principles, free/pro boundaries, and non-goals.
- `DESIGN.md`: concise product design contract for admin UI patterns, screen hierarchy, components/controls, empty/loading/error/success states, accessibility, responsive behavior, WordPress.org/website assets, copy/tone, visual non-goals, and the default UI baseline. Use the [WordPress Design System](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1436359662053949167/wordpress-design-system) as the starting point, then layer each product's brand colors and product-specific identity on top of it.
- `TESTING.md`: repo-specific smoke, proof, fixtures, environments, and validation shortcuts when they are not already clear in `AGENTS.md`.
- `ROADMAP.md`: milestone sequence, release intent, current priorities, and deferred work.
- `RELEASE.md`: beta/stable process, packaging, main-first production merge/tag/release sequence, post-release ancestry and forward-sync checks, WordPress.org or marketplace steps, rollback notes.
- `PLAYGROUND.md`: repo-specific WordPress Playground preview rules, entry routes, test users, and packaging caveats when Playground support matters.
- `docs/decisions/ADR-xxxx.md`: material architecture or product decisions.

Do not create these files automatically for every repo. Recommend or create them only when a real durable gap exists and the user or repo workflow supports it.

`DESIGN.md` is not a heavy design-system spec. Product orchestrators should create or adapt it only through duplicate-screened product issues, not blind docs churn. Prioritize products with active UI drift, onboarding risk, or an upcoming design-heavy train; keep it lightweight when the product surface is small.

Portfolio CTO and product POs should audit active products for missing, weak, or stale `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `TESTING.md`, and `RELEASE.md` guidance. Create focused GitHub issues instead of relying on chat instructions unless a tiny owner-approved docs fix is safer. Repo-specific workflow rules belong here; cross-product orchestration rules belong in the WP Expert skills and shared references.

Treat product docs as self-improving, not one-time setup. When a finding changes how future workers should behave, add or queue a concise repo-specific rule in `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `TESTING.md`, `RELEASE.md`, architecture docs, or relevant README/docs instead of leaving it only in chat memory.

## When To Update Docs

Update or recommend docs when:

- Repeated chats drift on the same branch, release, or product rule.
- A milestone or release train rule is ambiguous.
- A product decision affects multiple future issues.
- A repo automation needs stable local instructions.
- A release workflow can publish from `release/*`, auto-create a tag, or finish without proving the production tag is reachable from `main`.
- GitHub issue comments alone would hide important long-term context.
- An active product still depends on chat-only instructions for workflow, design, testing, or release behavior.
- A design-visible issue lacks before screenshots, or a design-visible PR lacks after screenshots.
- Unexpected behavior, maintainability debt, weak non-obvious comments, missing test coverage, repeated validation/tooling surprises, or workflow friction teaches a reusable product-specific rule.

Keep docs concise and repo-specific. Do not duplicate broad `wp-expert` or `wp-product-orchestrator` guidance in every product repo.
