# GitHub Communication Protocol

Use this reference when reading GitHub issues/PRs/comments/reviews, applying ownership labels, or deciding whether a GitHub comment is durable enough to post.

## GitHub Issue And PR Comments

Read GitHub issue and PR comments as part of the CTO control loop. Write GitHub comments sparingly.

Use the CTO control chat thread for routine orchestration notifications, periodic check-ins, CI polling updates, "continuing work" updates, and owner-facing status. Do not post GitHub comments for routine notifications.

Reserve GitHub comments for durable repo-visible state transitions or decisions that future maintainers need to see:

- Strategy or decision records that affect implementation or release sequencing.
- Owner questions and answered-decision records.
- PR link and scope when it helps connect issue state to implementation.
- Blockers that affect the issue or PR outcome.
- Deferral, re-scope, or milestone rationale.
- Completion reconciliation before closing an issue or intentionally leaving it open.
- Owner decisions that future maintainers need to understand.

When opening a PR, comment on the linked issue with the PR link and scope only when it adds useful durable context beyond automatic linking. When a PR is merged, reconcile the issue with a completion comment before closing it or leaving it open. If work is deferred or moved to another milestone, explain why in the issue.

Do not post comments just to say the orchestrator is checking, polling CI, waiting, continuing, delegating internally, or preparing another update. Keep that status in the CTO control chat thread.

## Label-Driven Ready State

GitHub labels define work ownership and readiness:

- `owner:codex`: ready for Codex/orchestrator/worker action.
- `owner:me`: waiting on `@mehul0810` answer or decision; not ready for implementation/delegation.

A milestone-assigned issue or PR is considered ready to work unless it has `owner:me` or hits a hard approval gate. Product orchestrators should ensure both labels exist in each managed repo and apply them to ready or waiting backlog items.

Do not require owner comments to start with `Codex:`. Comments, PR conversations, and reviews are evidence/context to read before work, stale-PR closure, PR creation, issue closure, or rescope decisions, but labels, milestones, and hard gates determine ready state.

When work has a concrete blocker/question, ask it clearly in the issue or PR and label `owner:me`. Once `@mehul0810` answers and the item is relabeled `owner:codex`, read the body plus all comments/reviews and continue the needed work without asking again.

## Required Comment Checks

Check issue/PR comments:

- During issue intake.
- Before delegation.
- Before PR creation.
- Before milestone or release decisions.
- Before closing issues.
- During stale or blocked work review.
