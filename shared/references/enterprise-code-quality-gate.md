# Enterprise Code Quality Gate

Use this for WordPress code creation, refactoring, and review when the output should meet enterprise, WP VIP-style, or long-lived product standards.

## Principle

Treat every generated or reviewed code path as production code for a high-traffic, security-sensitive WordPress environment unless the user explicitly accepts a lower bar. Prefer the simplest design that is modular, performant, secure, maintainable, observable, and testable under realistic failure modes.

## Before Writing Code

- Define the contract: hooks, filters, REST routes, block attributes, options, meta keys, schema versions, CLI commands, queue hooks, assets, templates, and public APIs.
- Define ownership: theme vs plugin, bootstrap vs module, domain logic vs persistence, admin/editor UI vs frontend rendering, provider adapter vs core service.
- Identify trust boundaries: request input, REST/AJAX, webhooks, uploads, imports, cron/action queues, external APIs, editor attributes, and saved content.
- Identify hot paths: page render, REST/editor load, checkout/forms, search, admin bootstrap, list tables, cron, migrations, and cache misses.
- Decide validation: unit, integration, WP test suite, JS tests, e2e, visual, accessibility, static analysis, runtime smoke, or manual evidence.
- Avoid premature abstraction, but do not duplicate rules that can drift across entry points, providers, migrations, or tests.

## Implementation Bar

- Keep bootstraps thin and composition explicit; move behavior into named modules/classes/functions with one clear reason to change.
- Pass dependencies where practical; avoid hidden globals except at WordPress integration boundaries.
- Make data contracts explicit through schemas, DTO-like arrays, typed methods where supported, and documented option/meta/table shapes.
- Bound every query, loop, migration, remote call, queue batch, cache payload, and rendered collection.
- Sanitize and validate on ingress; escape at the output boundary; authorize with capabilities and object ownership before mutation or disclosure.
- Make side effects idempotent, retry-safe, race-aware, and observable with redacted logs/status where appropriate.
- Use deterministic cache keys with the right dimensions and invalidation near the data owner.
- Keep admin/editor/frontend assets scoped to the screens, blocks, templates, or routes that need them.
- Preserve backward compatibility for launched contracts and real data; remove or reshape unreleased draft code instead of adding unnecessary shims.
- Add concise comments only for non-obvious security, compatibility, cache, migration, concurrency, or platform decisions.

## Test Expectations

Tests should prove behavior, not just line coverage. Choose the smallest reliable set that covers the changed risk.

Cover common paths:

- Successful authorized operation.
- Validation failure and user-facing error shape.
- Permission denied or unauthenticated access.
- Persistence read/write, cache hit/miss, and invalidation when relevant.
- Rendered output, REST response, block save/render, or admin/editor UI behavior.

Cover rare and failure scenarios when relevant:

- Empty, missing, malformed, oversized, translated, RTL, long-string, and special-character inputs.
- Deleted/missing referenced posts, terms, users, files, options, jobs, or remote records.
- Duplicate submissions, retries, concurrent runners, stale cache, expired tokens, and partial migrations.
- Multisite blog/network scope, switched blog restoration, role/capability variations, and object ownership.
- External API timeout, 429/rate limit, 5xx, invalid JSON/XML, auth failure, webhook replay, and idempotency conflict.
- Large data volume, pagination boundaries, indexed lookup paths, and no-result states.
- Editor reload, invalid block avoidance, frontend parity, keyboard navigation, focus, contrast, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Activation, upgrade, rollback/backout, uninstall, and production artifact boundaries.

When tests are not feasible locally, provide the strongest available evidence and explicitly name the untested risk.

## Review Gate

For code review, block or flag code that:

- Mixes unrelated responsibilities in a way that prevents focused tests or safe changes.
- Adds unbounded queries, synchronous remote calls on hot paths, global asset loading, or large autoloaded options.
- Misses capability checks, object ownership checks, REST permission callbacks, nonce/CSRF protection, sanitization, escaping, SQL preparation, SSRF protection, or secret/PII redaction.
- Introduces broad refactors without reducing concrete risk or improving testability.
- Adds compatibility for unreleased intermediate shapes instead of cleaning the final contract.
- Lacks tests for the changed behavior or skips rare scenarios that match the risk.
- Produces generated code that works only for the happy path and would fail under scale, multisite, cache, race, migration, or editor/frontend parity conditions.

## Completion Rule

Do not call work done until implementation, tests or validation, and residual risk are all stated with evidence. If the repo lacks tooling, use syntax/static/runtime smoke checks and say what deeper gates were unavailable.
