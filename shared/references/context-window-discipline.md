# Context Window Discipline

Use this reference when the active conversation is large, the task may drift because of old chat history, or the user asks about compaction, fresh threads, continuity, or token usage.

## Decision Rule

- Continuity-sensitive task: ask the user to compact the current thread when context is high. Use this for the same issue, PR, release train, product heartbeat, in-progress implementation, or unresolved decision chain.
- New or unrelated task: recommend a fresh thread instead of compacting. Rehydrate from source of truth: repo files, Git status, issues/PRs, docs, and current runtime evidence.
- Unclear task: prefer compact only when important decisions exist only in the current chat. Otherwise prefer fresh thread plus source-of-truth rehydration.

## What Compact Means

- Compact preserves a summarized version of prior context so the same work can continue with fewer stale details.
- Compact is not a substitute for verification. Re-check repo/GitHub/runtime facts before acting on branch, release, issue, PR, or production-sensitive assumptions.
- Ask for compact before starting substantial continuation work when the context is high and the current thread contains unresolved task state.

## What Fresh Thread Means

- Fresh thread gives the cleanest token reset and lowest drift risk.
- Use fresh threads for unrelated tasks, broad new planning, independent implementation, or worker delegation.
- Do not carry old chat assumptions into a fresh thread unless they are durable in repo docs, issues/PRs, commits, or explicit handoff notes.

## Product Orchestration Rules

- `wp-portfolio-cto` and product control threads should stay high-level. Do not let them absorb implementation logs, CI noise, or large code-reading output.
- Start recurring portfolio/product work with a compact source-of-truth summary from repo/GitHub/runtime evidence. Do not reread full thread history unless the missing decision is not durable anywhere else.
- Load one primary reference plus one supporting reference by default. Load additional references only after a concrete risk, blocker, or artifact boundary proves they are needed.
- For portfolio heartbeats, use compact exception sweeps first: active blockers, owner decisions, moving PRs/releases, unhealthy threads/workers, and material drift. Prefer fresh product/worker threads for unrelated product execution and compact only when continuing the same portfolio decision chain.
- For product heartbeats, compact the product thread when continuing the same release train and context is high; create or use bounded worker threads for implementation/evidence work.
- For small stateful execution that should not live in CTO or a product PO thread, prefer a disposable `Worker Threads` execution room with a clear stop condition, then reconcile and archive/delete it.
- For a new product or unrelated product initiative, prefer a fresh worker/product thread and rehydrate from the source-of-truth hierarchy.
- When prompt/context is already large, do not batch broad thread/GitHub reads. Read one product/thread/PR at a time with compact options: no outputs, no diffs unless needed, low limits, and URLs plus short deltas instead of pasted state. If a full skill body or long heartbeat payload is pasted into the thread, treat it as a stale snapshot, patch source-of-truth files if needed, and do not echo it back.
- Before asking the owner to compact, complete cheap source-of-truth checks that do not depend on old chat history; then state why compact is better than a fresh thread.
- Stop high-context recurring product heartbeats after source-of-truth verification, one highest-leverage action/delegation, and a concise next stop condition. Do not keep polling stale history when there is no new issue, PR, CI, release, owner label, or repo signal.

## Status Phrase

Use one concise line when relevant:

`Context decision: Compact|Fresh thread|Continue - <reason>`
