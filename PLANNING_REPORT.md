# WordPress Expert Codex Skill Planning Report

## Objective

Create a Codex skill that helps future agents operate like a principal WordPress engineer with enterprise and WordPress VIP experience: fast context discovery, high-signal review, safe implementation, strong validation, and token-efficient use of deeper references.

## Design Principles

- Token-efficient by default: keep `SKILL.md` short and route deeper knowledge to references only when relevant.
- Evidence-first: require repository facts, runtime mapping, file/line findings, and validation commands.
- Enterprise-grade: include security, performance, async jobs, data migrations, multisite, cache strategy, observability, and release readiness.
- VIP-aware but not stale: encode stable platform principles and require current official-doc verification for exact VIP policy.
- Implementation-focused: guide Codex to make narrow durable changes, not generic advice or broad refactors.
- Safety-first: preserve local work, protect secrets/PII, avoid destructive DB/filesystem actions, and respect production boundaries.

## Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact hot-path `SKILL.md` | Yes | Add | Keeps future invocations fast while still enforcing senior engineering behavior. |
| Reference routing map | Yes | Add | Lets Codex load only the needed deep playbook, reducing token and memory waste. |
| Review checklist | Yes | Add | Produces sharper audits with concrete file/line impact instead of generic WordPress commentary. |
| Enterprise architecture playbook | Yes | Add | Captures principal-level design patterns for services, data, async, caching, migrations, and BC. |
| VIP scale playbook | Yes | Add | Encodes VIP-scale assumptions while pointing to official docs for drift-prone policies. |
| Implementation patterns | Yes | Add | Speeds safe code generation for REST, AJAX, SQL, async token jobs, cache, assets, and dynamic blocks. |
| Validation command reference | Yes | Add | Makes verification practical across WP-CLI, Studio, Composer, npm, and wp-load.php environments. |
| Read-only helper scripts | Yes | Add | Gives future agents deterministic repo discovery and lightweight validation without loading large instructions. |
| Massive WordPress encyclopedia | No | Skip | Would waste context and duplicate model knowledge. The skill should teach process and sharp heuristics, not generic docs. |
| Hard-coded current VIP rules only | No | Refine | VIP policies change. The skill uses stable principles and tells Codex to verify exact current rules. |

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated monorepo playbook | Yes | Add | Monorepo work has unique WordPress discovery, artifact, symlink, and release failure modes that generic plugin guidance misses. |
| Add only a README bullet | No | Reject | The skill router must know when to load monorepo guidance. |
| Add heavy scripts now | Not yet | Defer | Deterministic monorepo scripts should be added only after repeated repo-specific workflows justify them. |

### Added Artifact

- `references/monorepo-engineering.md`

## Plugin Guidelines And Build Tooling Addition

### Objective

Add WordPress.org Plugin Directory guideline reviewer expertise plus webpack, Composer, and npm build/dependency tooling expertise as first-class skill routes.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated plugin guideline review playbook | Yes | Add | Directory submission and rejection remediation are policy reviews, not just code reviews. |
| Dedicated build tooling playbook | Yes | Add | Webpack/Composer/npm failures are common in modern WordPress plugins, blocks, themes, and monorepos. |
| Fold build tooling into CI docs only | No | Reject | Build debugging often happens outside CI and needs its own decision path. |
| Hard-code guidelines forever | No | Reject | Plugin guidelines change, so the skill must verify official docs for real submissions. |

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated WordPress design system playbook | Yes | Add | It lets Codex translate UI/UX ideas into WordPress-native components instead of generic React/admin UI. |
| Put design guidance only in admin UX file | No | Reject | Design system work also spans block editor, Figma-to-code, theme tokens, and component APIs. |
| Hard-code component props | No | Reject | Component APIs change; the skill should require current official docs/Storybook checks for exact implementation details. |

## REST-First Endpoint Guidance Addition

### Objective

Add a durable guideline that new interactive WordPress endpoints should use REST API by default and should not use `admin-ajax.php` when REST can satisfy the same use case.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST-first hard rule | Yes | Add | It prevents new legacy AJAX surfaces and improves schemas, permissions, client integration, and testability. |
| Absolute ban on all AJAX | No | Refine | Existing public actions and legacy integrations sometimes require compatibility wrappers. |
| Migration wrapper pattern | Yes | Add | Gives Codex a safe path for legacy AJAX without duplicating business logic. |

## UI/UX Pro And WPDS Fusion Addition

### Objective

Improve the WordPress UI/UX guidance by synthesizing product-grade UI/UX reasoning from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` with WordPress-native WPDS guidance from `WordPress/agent-skills`.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated WordPress UI/UX pro reference | Yes | Add | It gives Codex a product UX quality bar without turning every UI task into generic design advice. |
| Fuse with WPDS rather than replace it | Yes | Add | Product-grade UX and WordPress-native components solve different parts of the problem. |
| Copy full UI/UX data tables | No | Reject | The data set is large and not WordPress-specific; a distilled decision framework is more token-efficient. |
| Introduce Tailwind/shadcn defaults | No | Reject | WordPress admin/editor UI should map to WPDS first unless the project already uses another app stack. |

### Added Artifact

## Editor UI Placement Addition

### Objective

Add guidance for choosing the right WordPress editor UI surface: meta boxes for classic editor post-edit metadata, document settings panels for block editor document-level settings, and inspector/block panels for block-specific controls.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit editor surface rule | Yes | Add | It prevents generic admin UI from landing in the wrong editor surface and improves editor-native UX. |
| Always use meta boxes | No | Reject | Meta boxes are appropriate for classic editor and legacy compatibility, but block editor has better native panel surfaces. |
| Always use document panels | No | Reject | Block-specific settings belong with the block, not in the document sidebar. |

### Updated Artifacts

- `SKILL.md`
- `references/admin-ux-and-ui.md`
- `references/theme-and-block-editor.md`
- `references/ui-ux-pro-for-wordpress.md`
- `references/wordpress-design-system.md`

### Block Editor Meta Box Constraint

- New meta boxes should not be shown in the block editor.
- If post metadata UI is needed in the block editor, use a document settings panel for document-level data or a block inspector/panel for block-specific data.
- Keep meta boxes classic-editor-only unless an existing legacy integration requires compatibility.

## Delivery Excellence Optimization

### Objective

Consolidate delivery planning and execution expertise into one reference covering client requirements, PRDs, scope of work, technical estimates, milestones, Codex-aware buffers, mobile-first responsive architecture, token discipline, planning, confirmation gates, enterprise implementation choices, GitHub workflows, testing, and maintainable comments.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated delivery excellence reference | Yes | Add | Keeps requirements, estimates, execution discipline, testing, and GitHub workflow together instead of scattering them. |
| Mobile-first responsive architecture | Yes | Add | Frontend and customer-facing WordPress work must be designed from constrained viewports first. |
| Codex-aware estimation with buffer | Yes | Add | Gives realistic estimates that account for AI acceleration and remaining validation/review risk. |
| Confirmation before done | Yes | Add | Prevents premature completion claims by requiring evidence and known-gap reporting. |
| Enterprise GitHub workflow standards | Yes | Add | Issues, labels, milestones, PR descriptions, commits, review replies, and release notes should match enterprise delivery quality. |
| Always verbose comments | No | Refine | Comments should explain why and document contracts, not restate obvious code. |

## Enterprise Operations And Hyper-Scale Additions

### Objective

Add the missing highest-priority enterprise/VIP operations expertise for WordPress properties serving very high traffic: observability and incident response, edge caching/CDN architecture, load testing/capacity planning, Enterprise Search/content scale, security operations/compliance, deployment/release resilience, content migration/editorial scale, and accessibility/i18n/global readiness.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observability and incident response | Yes | Add | Million-visits-per-hour systems need SLOs, logs, metrics, traces, runbooks, and postmortems, not only code fixes. |
| Edge caching and CDN architecture | Yes | Add | Page cacheability and origin protection are core architectural requirements at VIP scale. |
| Load testing and capacity planning | Yes | Add | Launch readiness requires traffic models, realistic cache/origin assumptions, failure thresholds, and VIP coordination. |
| Enterprise Search and content scale | Yes | Add | Large content archives need search/index offload strategy instead of MySQL-heavy search/meta queries. |
| Security operations and compliance | Yes | Add | Enterprise clients need access governance, audit evidence, vulnerability handling, pen-test coordination, and privacy controls. |
| Deployment and release resilience | Yes | Add | High-traffic releases require artifacts, feature flags, rollback, migration safety, smoke checks, and communication discipline. |
| Content migration and editorial scale | Yes | Add | Large migrations need data integrity, redirects, media strategy, editorial workflow continuity, and cutover planning. |
| Accessibility, i18n, and global readiness | Yes | Add | Enterprise WordPress must support WCAG-aligned UX, translations, RTL, multilingual SEO, and locale-aware behavior. |
| One giant operations manual | No | Reject | A giant file would waste tokens. Focused references preserve the compact router model. |
| Hard-code all VIP limits forever | No | Refine | VIP policies and limits change; references include stable patterns and source anchors to verify current details. |

## React With WordPress Enterprise Standards Addition

### Objective

Add first-class expertise for using React inside WordPress with enterprise standards across admin apps, block editor UI, frontend interactive blocks, headless/decoupled boundaries, data stores, REST contracts, build tooling, accessibility, performance, security, testing, and release artifacts.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated React with WordPress playbook | Yes | Add | React in WordPress has unique runtime, dependency, REST, editor, and release-artifact constraints that generic React guidance misses. |
| WordPress-provided React/dependency extraction guidance | Yes | Add | Prevents duplicate React bundles, broken dependency handles, missing asset files, and inflated admin/editor payloads. |
| REST and `@wordpress/data` boundaries | Yes | Add | Enterprise React apps need stable server contracts, permission checks, pagination, errors, and scalable client state. |
| Interactivity API decision rule | Yes | Add | Frontend block interactivity should not default to a full React mount when WordPress-native interactivity is sufficient. |
| Accessibility/security/testing gates | Yes | Add | Enterprise React work must prove roles, a11y, build artifacts, dependency safety, and failure states, not only happy-path rendering. |
| Fold into build tooling only | No | Reject | Build tooling is necessary but not enough; React architecture spans UI, data, security, performance, and release review. |
