# WP Expert Codex Skill Planning Report

## Objective

Create a Codex skill that helps future agents operate like a principal WordPress engineer with enterprise and WordPress VIP experience: fast context discovery, high-signal review, safe implementation, strong validation, and token-efficient use of deeper references.

## Design Principles

- Token-efficient by default: keep `SKILL.md` short and route deeper knowledge to references only when relevant.
- Evidence-first: require repository facts, runtime mapping, file/line findings, and validation commands.
- Enterprise-grade: include security, performance, async jobs, data migrations, multisite, cache strategy, observability, and release readiness.
- VIP-aware but not stale: encode stable platform principles and require current official-doc verification for exact VIP policy.
- Implementation-focused: guide Codex to make narrow durable changes, not generic advice or broad refactors.
- Safety-first: preserve local work, protect secrets/PII, avoid destructive DB/filesystem actions, and respect production boundaries.

## Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact hot-path `SKILL.md` | Yes | Add | Keeps future invocations fast while still enforcing senior engineering behavior. |
| Reference routing map | Yes | Add | Lets Codex load only the needed deep playbook, reducing token and memory waste. |
| Review checklist | Yes | Add | Produces sharper audits with concrete file/line impact instead of generic WordPress commentary. |
| Enterprise architecture playbook | Yes | Add | Captures principal-level design patterns for services, data, async, caching, migrations, and BC. |
| VIP scale playbook | Yes | Add | Encodes VIP-scale assumptions while pointing to official docs for drift-prone policies. |
| Implementation patterns | Yes | Add | Speeds safe code generation for REST, AJAX, SQL, async token jobs, cache, assets, and dynamic blocks. |
| Validation command reference | Yes | Add | Makes verification practical across WP-CLI, Studio, Composer, npm, and wp-load.php environments. |
| Read-only helper scripts | Yes | Add | Gives future agents deterministic repo discovery and lightweight validation without loading large instructions. |
| Massive WordPress encyclopedia | No | Skip | Would waste context and duplicate model knowledge. The skill should teach process and sharp heuristics, not generic docs. |
| Hard-coded current VIP rules only | No | Refine | VIP policies change. The skill uses stable principles and tells Codex to verify exact current rules. |

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated monorepo playbook | Yes | Add | Monorepo work has unique WordPress discovery, artifact, symlink, and release failure modes that generic plugin guidance misses. |
| Add only a README bullet | No | Reject | The skill router must know when to load monorepo guidance. |
| Add heavy scripts now | Not yet | Defer | Deterministic monorepo scripts should be added only after repeated repo-specific workflows justify them. |

### Added Artifact

- `references/monorepo-engineering.md`

## Plugin Guidelines And Build Tooling Addition

### Objective

Add WordPress.org Plugin Directory guideline reviewer expertise plus webpack, Composer, and npm build/dependency tooling expertise as first-class skill routes.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated plugin guideline review playbook | Yes | Add | Directory submission and rejection remediation are policy reviews, not just code reviews. |
| Dedicated build tooling playbook | Yes | Add | Webpack/Composer/npm failures are common in modern WordPress plugins, blocks, themes, and monorepos. |
| Fold build tooling into CI docs only | No | Reject | Build debugging often happens outside CI and needs its own decision path. |
| Hard-code guidelines forever | No | Reject | Plugin guidelines change, so the skill must verify official docs for real submissions. |

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated WordPress design system playbook | Yes | Add | It lets Codex translate UI/UX ideas into WordPress-native components instead of generic React/admin UI. |
| Put design guidance only in admin UX file | No | Reject | Design system work also spans block editor, Figma-to-code, theme tokens, and component APIs. |
| Hard-code component props | No | Reject | Component APIs change; the skill should require current official docs/Storybook checks for exact implementation details. |

## REST-First Endpoint Guidance Addition

### Objective

Add a durable guideline that new interactive WordPress endpoints should use REST API by default and should not use `admin-ajax.php` when REST can satisfy the same use case.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST-first hard rule | Yes | Add | It prevents new legacy AJAX surfaces and improves schemas, permissions, client integration, and testability. |
| Absolute ban on all AJAX | No | Refine | Existing public actions and legacy integrations sometimes require compatibility wrappers. |
| Migration wrapper pattern | Yes | Add | Gives Codex a safe path for legacy AJAX without duplicating business logic. |

## UI/UX Pro And WPDS Fusion Addition

### Objective

Improve the WordPress UI/UX guidance by synthesizing product-grade UI/UX reasoning from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` with WordPress-native WPDS guidance from `WordPress/agent-skills`.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated WordPress UI/UX pro reference | Yes | Add | It gives Codex a product UX quality bar without turning every UI task into generic design advice. |
| Fuse with WPDS rather than replace it | Yes | Add | Product-grade UX and WordPress-native components solve different parts of the problem. |
| Copy full UI/UX data tables | No | Reject | The data set is large and not WordPress-specific; a distilled decision framework is more token-efficient. |
| Introduce Tailwind/shadcn defaults | No | Reject | WordPress admin/editor UI should map to WPDS first unless the project already uses another app stack. |

### Added Artifact

- `references/ui-ux-pro-for-wordpress.md`

### Source Repositories Reviewed

- WordPress agent skills WPDS skill: https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills/tree/trunk/skills/wpds

## Editor UI Placement Addition

### Objective

Add guidance for choosing the right WordPress editor UI surface: meta boxes for classic editor post-edit metadata, document settings panels for block editor document-level settings, and inspector/block panels for block-specific controls.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit editor surface rule | Yes | Add | It prevents generic admin UI from landing in the wrong editor surface and improves editor-native UX. |
| Always use meta boxes | No | Reject | Meta boxes are appropriate for classic editor and legacy compatibility, but block editor has better native panel surfaces. |
| Always use document panels | No | Reject | Block-specific settings belong with the block, not in the document sidebar. |

### Updated Artifacts

- `SKILL.md`
- `references/admin-ux-and-ui.md`
- `references/theme-and-block-editor.md`
- `references/ui-ux-pro-for-wordpress.md`
- `references/wordpress-design-system.md`

### Block Editor Meta Box Constraint

- New meta boxes should not be shown in the block editor.
- If post metadata UI is needed in the block editor, use a document settings panel for document-level data or a block inspector/panel for block-specific data.
- Keep meta boxes classic-editor-only unless an existing legacy integration requires compatibility.

## Delivery Excellence Optimization

### Objective

Consolidate delivery planning and execution expertise into one reference covering client requirements, PRDs, scope of work, technical estimates, milestones, Codex-aware buffers, mobile-first responsive architecture, token discipline, planning, confirmation gates, enterprise implementation choices, GitHub workflows, testing, and maintainable comments.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated delivery excellence reference | Yes | Add | Keeps requirements, estimates, execution discipline, testing, and GitHub workflow together instead of scattering them. |
| Mobile-first responsive architecture | Yes | Add | Frontend and customer-facing WordPress work must be designed from constrained viewports first. |
| Codex-aware estimation with buffer | Yes | Add | Gives realistic estimates that account for AI acceleration and remaining validation/review risk. |
| Confirmation before done | Yes | Add | Prevents premature completion claims by requiring evidence and known-gap reporting. |
| Enterprise GitHub workflow standards | Yes | Add | Issues, labels, milestones, PR descriptions, commits, review replies, and release notes should match enterprise delivery quality. |
| Always verbose comments | No | Refine | Comments should explain why and document contracts, not restate obvious code. |

## Enterprise Operations And Hyper-Scale Additions

### Objective

Add the missing highest-priority enterprise/VIP operations expertise for WordPress properties serving very high traffic: observability and incident response, edge caching/CDN architecture, load testing/capacity planning, Enterprise Search/content scale, security operations/compliance, deployment/release resilience, content migration/editorial scale, and accessibility/i18n/global readiness.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observability and incident response | Yes | Add | Million-visits-per-hour systems need SLOs, logs, metrics, traces, runbooks, and postmortems, not only code fixes. |
| Edge caching and CDN architecture | Yes | Add | Page cacheability and origin protection are core architectural requirements at VIP scale. |
| Load testing and capacity planning | Yes | Add | Launch readiness requires traffic models, realistic cache/origin assumptions, failure thresholds, and VIP coordination. |
| Enterprise Search and content scale | Yes | Add | Large content archives need search/index offload strategy instead of MySQL-heavy search/meta queries. |
| Security operations and compliance | Yes | Add | Enterprise clients need access governance, audit evidence, vulnerability handling, pen-test coordination, and privacy controls. |
| Deployment and release resilience | Yes | Add | High-traffic releases require artifacts, feature flags, rollback, migration safety, smoke checks, and communication discipline. |
| Content migration and editorial scale | Yes | Add | Large migrations need data integrity, redirects, media strategy, editorial workflow continuity, and cutover planning. |
| Accessibility, i18n, and global readiness | Yes | Add | Enterprise WordPress must support WCAG-aligned UX, translations, RTL, multilingual SEO, and locale-aware behavior. |
| One giant operations manual | No | Reject | A giant file would waste tokens. Focused references preserve the compact router model. |
| Hard-code all VIP limits forever | No | Refine | VIP policies and limits change; references include stable patterns and source anchors to verify current details. |

## React With WordPress Enterprise Standards Addition

### Objective

Add first-class expertise for using React inside WordPress with enterprise standards across admin apps, block editor UI, frontend interactive blocks, headless/decoupled boundaries, data stores, REST contracts, build tooling, accessibility, performance, security, testing, and release artifacts.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated React with WordPress playbook | Yes | Add | React in WordPress has unique runtime, dependency, REST, editor, and release-artifact constraints that generic React guidance misses. |
| WordPress-provided React/dependency extraction guidance | Yes | Add | Prevents duplicate React bundles, broken dependency handles, missing asset files, and inflated admin/editor payloads. |
| REST and `@wordpress/data` boundaries | Yes | Add | Enterprise React apps need stable server contracts, permission checks, pagination, errors, and scalable client state. |
| Interactivity API decision rule | Yes | Add | Frontend block interactivity should not default to a full React mount when WordPress-native interactivity is sufficient. |
| Accessibility/security/testing gates | Yes | Add | Enterprise React work must prove roles, a11y, build artifacts, dependency safety, and failure states, not only happy-path rendering. |
| Fold into build tooling only | No | Reject | Build tooling is necessary but not enough; React architecture spans UI, data, security, performance, and release review. |

## Third-Party API Integration Expertise Addition

### Objective

Add first-class expertise for working with third-party APIs of any type by using current official documentation, user-provided specs, or discoverable API references. The skill should search for API docs when not provided and ask for docs/specs or missing contract details when reliable documentation cannot be found.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated third-party API integration playbook | Yes | Add | External integrations have provider-specific contracts, auth, rate limits, retries, webhooks, and operational failure modes that generic plugin guidance misses. |
| Documentation-first rule | Yes | Add | Prevents invented endpoints, stale assumptions, and unsafe implementations when provider APIs change. |
| Search-then-ask workflow | Yes | Add | Lets Codex find official docs when possible and ask the user for docs/specs when the API is private, missing, or ambiguous. |
| Protocol-agnostic coverage | Yes | Add | Enterprise WordPress work touches REST, GraphQL, SOAP/WSDL, XML-RPC, SDK-only APIs, webhooks, file/SFTP, and batch APIs. |
| Security and secret-handling gates | Yes | Add | API work often includes tokens, webhook secrets, PII, logs, cron args, and localized JS exposure risks. |
| Fold into performance/security only | No | Reject | Third-party integration needs its own route because docs discovery, auth flows, provider testing, and operational support are distinct workflows. |

### Added Artifact

## Runtime And Toolchain Version Policy Addition

### Objective

Add a durable rule that new minimum versions for PHP, Node, npm, Composer, databases, CI images, GitHub Actions, and other tools must be the lowest stable actively maintained non-EOL version that satisfies WordPress, host/VIP, dependency, and deployment constraints.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated runtime/toolchain version policy | Yes | Add | Version minimums affect security, supportability, CI reliability, hosting compatibility, and public-plugin backward compatibility. |
| Official lifecycle verification | Yes | Add | PHP, Node, database, npm, Composer, and action support windows change; the skill must verify current official lifecycle docs. |
| Lowest active stable baseline rule | Yes | Add | Avoids both obsolete/EOL versions and unnecessary bleeding-edge requirements. |
| Public-plugin migration caution | Yes | Add | Raising minimum versions can be a backward-compatibility break and should be planned, not silently shipped. |
| Update stale CI example versions | Yes | Add | Existing generic CI examples must not teach EOL Node/PHP choices. |
| Hard-code permanent version numbers only | No | Reject | Runtime lifecycles drift; permanent hard-coded versions would become incorrect. Use current examples plus verification instructions. |

### Added Artifact

## Changelog And Release Notes Expertise Addition

### Objective

Add first-class expertise for writing WordPress/product changelogs and release notes, including the rule that fixes and improvements to unreleased features should be folded into the original `Added` entry instead of creating fake `Improved` or `Fixed` entries.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated changelog/release-notes playbook | Yes | Add | Changelog quality directly affects client communication, WordPress.org releases, GitHub releases, and upgrade confidence. |
| Unreleased feature aggregation rule | Yes | Add | Prevents noise and misleading fixed/improved entries for behavior users never received. |
| Release-state matrix | Yes | Add | Beta, client preview, feature flags, internal QA, and public release all need different treatment. |
| WordPress.org readme guidance | Yes | Add | WordPress plugin changelogs must account for readme parsing, stable tag behavior, validator usage, and readme size. |
| Audience-based categories | Yes | Add | WordPress products need user/admin/developer/operator/security/migration notes, not just raw commit types. |
| Dump git log into changelog | No | Reject | Changelogs should be outcome-based, verified from diffs/PRs/tags, and written for the release audience. |

### Added Artifact

## Release Contract Compatibility Policy Addition

### Objective

Add expertise to prevent unnecessary backward-compatibility shims for unreleased in-progress feature shapes. Compatibility should protect launched/public contracts and real production/client data, not temporary implementation details created while a feature is being reworked before first launch or before the next release ships.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated release-contract compatibility playbook | Yes | Add | Prevents over-engineering shims, migrations, fallback reads, route aliases, and tests for draft feature shapes that users never received. |
| Release-state matrix | Yes | Add | Internal QA, private preview, public beta/RC, production feature flags, and stable releases require different compatibility decisions. |
| WordPress contract-surface checklist | Yes | Add | Options, meta keys, custom tables, REST routes, hooks, blocks, shortcodes, WP-CLI, template paths, asset handles, and docs can all become released contracts. |
| Cross-link from architecture and implementation references | Yes | Add | The broad "preserve backward compatibility" rule needs narrower release-contract context at implementation time. |
| Always preserve every previous local shape | No | Reject | Draft shapes from unlaunched features should be deleted or replaced cleanly before launch. |
| Always ignore preview/beta/flagged data | No | Reject | If real users, client preview environments, public testers, or production flags consumed it, compatibility or migration may be required. |

### Added Artifact

- `references/release-contract-compatibility.md`

### Updated Artifacts

- `SKILL.md`: added release contract/backward compatibility to task classification, reference routing, and hard rules.
- `README.md`: documented release-contract compatibility coverage and default invocation.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: added release compatibility policy to the default invocation prompt.
- `references/enterprise-architecture.md`: narrowed the principal compatibility default and routed compatibility decisions to the new reference.

## Duplicate Code, Modularity, And Testability Review Addition

### Objective

Add first-class expertise for reviewing duplicate code and improving modularity, test coverage, simplicity, reliability, and maintainability in WordPress codebases.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated duplicate-code/modularity review playbook | Yes | Add | Duplicate logic drifts quickly across WordPress hooks, routes, settings, queries, provider clients, and tests. |
| WordPress duplication hotspots | Yes | Add | WordPress projects often repeat hooks, REST/AJAX paths, option/meta access, cache keys, block defaults, and provider clients. |
| Extraction decision rules | Yes | Add | Prevents over-abstraction while keeping real shared responsibilities testable and maintainable. |
| Test strategy for refactors | Yes | Add | Duplicate-code cleanup should increase behavior-level coverage and reduce brittle fixture drift. |
| Tooling guidance | Yes | Add | Uses existing tools first and recommends duplicate/complexity tooling only when signal is useful. |
| Refactor every similar block | No | Reject | Similar syntax is not enough; abstraction can hide domain differences and reduce simplicity. |

### Added Artifact

## Skill Rename To wp-expert

### Objective

Rename the installed Codex skill identity to `wp-expert` so the folder name, frontmatter name, default invocation, helper script examples, and local symlink all use the shorter skill name.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rename folder and frontmatter together | Yes | Add | Codex discovery should see one consistent skill identity instead of mismatched metadata and folder paths. |
| Update default invocation to `$wp-expert` | Yes | Add | The invocation users type should match the new skill name. |
| Update local symlink | Yes | Add | Local Codex usage should resolve immediately without depending on the old path. |
| Keep the old long-form symlink | No | Reject | Keeping both paths can create duplicate or confusing skill discovery. |

### Updated Artifacts

## WP Contributor Skill Addition

### Objective

Add a second skill named `wp-contributor` for official WordPress project contribution work across Core, Meta, Gutenberg, Trac, GitHub PRs, patches, testing, docs, triage, release/backport work, and contributor communication.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Separate `wp-contributor` skill | Yes | Add | Official WordPress contribution has different source-of-truth, etiquette, patch, ticket, and release rules than client/plugin implementation work. |
| Compact router plus references | Yes | Add | Keeps invocation efficient while still covering Core, Meta, Gutenberg, Trac, testing, standards, docs, props, and release workflows. |
| Core workflow reference | Yes | Add | Core uses trunk-first patches, SVN-backed history, Core Trac, and GitHub PR linkage rules that generic WordPress engineering misses. |
| Meta workflow reference | Yes | Add | WordPress.org and WordCamp.org projects have distinct production, privacy, deployment, and environment constraints. |
| Gutenberg workflow reference | Yes | Add | Block editor work uses GitHub-first issue/PR practices and package-specific tests while still affecting Core release behavior. |
| Triage and communication playbook | Yes | Add | Maintainer-ready comments, reproduction evidence, keywords, labels, and patch refreshes are central to upstream acceptance. |
| Validation and standards references | Yes | Add | Contribution work needs repo-native tests, coding standards, inline docs, props, dev-note awareness, and accessibility/i18n/performance checks. |
| Security/release reference | Yes | Add | Public issue creation can be harmful for vulnerabilities, and release phase changes require special caution. |
| Bundle every handbook page into the skill | No | Reject | Official docs change. The skill should route to current official anchors instead of duplicating the whole handbook. |

## Ollie Block Theme Expertise Addition

### Objective

Add first-class Ollie block theme and Ollie Pro expertise to `wp-expert`, covering free Ollie, Ollie Pro, Site Editor workflows, child themes, block theme structure, design tokens, Pro pattern library, setup wizard, starter sites, extensions, Menu Designer, WooCommerce use cases, authentication, local/staging behavior, and troubleshooting.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated Ollie reference | Yes | Add | Ollie has product-specific workflows, Pro plugin behavior, design tokens, pattern library decisions, and auth/licensing concerns that generic block theme guidance misses. |
| Free and Pro split | Yes | Add | Free Ollie is a block theme; Ollie Pro is a premium plugin with cloud patterns, setup wizard, starter sites, extensions, and account/auth behavior. |
| Child-theme and style-override guidance | Yes | Add | Ollie docs describe child-theme blank JSON overrides for disabling built-in styles, and parent theme edits would be fragile. |
| Pattern library decision rules | Yes | Add | Pro patterns can be inserted, copied, favorited, or downloaded into `/patterns`; each path has different maintenance and version-control implications. |
| Security guidance for Pro auth | Yes | Add | Site-wide authentication uses credentials in constants, so the skill must protect secrets and discourage committing credentials. |
| WooCommerce/Menu Designer coverage | Yes | Add | Ollie Pro increasingly targets WooCommerce and native block navigation workflows, which require accessibility, responsive, and conversion QA. |
| Hard-code all current style hex values | No | Reject | Active theme version/style variation can change; use current installed `theme.json` and docs instead of bloating the skill with volatile palettes. |

## Blocksy Theme Expertise Addition

### Objective

Add first-class Blocksy theme and Blocksy Pro expertise to `wp-expert`, covering free Blocksy, Blocksy Companion, Blocksy Pro, Customizer workflows, header/footer builders, starter sites, Content Blocks, Dynamic Data, Post Types Extra, Shop Extra/WooCommerce, Advanced Menu, Pro extensions, licensing, local/staging, multisite, developer hooks, snippets, and troubleshooting.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated Blocksy reference | Yes | Add | Blocksy is Customizer/header-footer-builder centric and has product-specific Companion/Pro modules that generic theme guidance misses. |
| Free, Companion, and Pro split | Yes | Add | The theme, free companion plugin, and Companion Pro plugin have different responsibilities, dependencies, and licensing constraints. |
| Content Blocks and Dynamic Data guidance | Yes | Add | Blocksy Pro uses Content Blocks, hooks, conditions, Dynamic Data, and Post Types Extra for template-like and dynamic layouts. |
| Shop Extra/WooCommerce route | Yes | Add | Blocksy Pro has a deep WooCommerce module surface that needs conversion, accessibility, mobile, AJAX, and performance validation. |
| License/local/staging/multisite guidance | Yes | Add | Blocksy Pro licensing, development domains, and multisite seats can affect delivery and deployment planning. |
| Treat Blocksy as a pure block theme | No | Reject | Blocksy is Gutenberg-friendly but Customizer/theme-builder centric, so Site Editor assumptions would lead to wrong implementation choices. |
| Put all feature tables into SKILL.md | No | Reject | The details are product-specific and drift-prone; a focused reference keeps runtime context efficient. |

## Gutenberg Project Contribution Guidelines Addition

### Objective

Strengthen `wp-contributor` for `wordpress/gutenberg` contribution work so Codex follows Gutenberg's current contribution guidelines, repository-management expectations, branch/rebase workflow, PR discipline, testing strategy, accessibility requirements, React Native/mobile parity checks, and package-boundary rules.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated Gutenberg contribution guideline expansion | Yes | Add | Gutenberg uses GitHub-first issue, PR, label, milestone, review, package, and CI workflows that differ from Core Trac-first contribution work. |
| Official anchor expansion | Yes | Add | Current `CONTRIBUTING.md`, code contribution, git workflow, repository management, coding, testing, accessibility, and React Native docs are the right process anchors. |
| Branch/rebase and PR discipline guidance | Yes | Add | Gutenberg expects focused feature branches, PR updates on the same branch, and rebasing onto `trunk` for merge readiness. |
| Label, milestone, and triage guidance | Yes | Add | Issues and PRs rely on actionable scope, current labels, milestones, and project context; the skill should recommend these without overclaiming permissions. |
| Package-boundary and public API rules | Yes | Add | Gutenberg is a monorepo with `@wordpress/*` packages, downstream consumers, public APIs, deprecations, and release implications. |
| Accessibility and React Native parity checks | Yes | Add | Official guidelines call out accessibility testing and native-file parity when changes affect shared names or mobile editor behavior. |
| Hard-code exact npm commands as permanent truth | No | Reject | Scripts and tool versions drift; the skill now directs Codex to inspect current `package.json`, `.nvmrc`, and docs before giving exact commands. |
| Duplicate the entire Gutenberg handbook | No | Reject | Full handbook duplication would waste tokens and become stale; focused guidance plus official anchors is more durable and efficient. |

## Shared Research Token Discipline Addition

### Objective

Add a focused reusable reference that makes token-efficient reasoning, repository exploration, web search, source selection, validation, and output discipline explicit for both `wp-expert` and `wp-contributor`.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared `research-token-discipline.md` reference | Yes | Add | Both skills need the same research discipline, and a shared file avoids duplicated guidance drifting apart. |
| Router entries in both skills | Yes | Add | The behavior must be discoverable when either skill is active, without loading the reference unless the task needs research discipline. |
| Frontmatter trigger wording | Yes | Add | Adding token-efficient research/web search to both skill descriptions makes the behavior explicit to Codex skill selection. |
| Search budget defaults | Yes | Add | Concrete budgets help Codex stop researching after enough primary evidence and spend more context on implementation and validation. |
| Repo exploration discipline | Yes | Add | WordPress tasks frequently waste tokens on broad file dumps; targeted `rg`, small reads, and repo scripts are more efficient. |
| Validation and output discipline | Yes | Add | Token savings should not reduce correctness; the reference requires evidence before saying work is done. |
| Duplicate the same reference inside each skill | No | Reject | Duplication would increase maintenance cost and risk inconsistent behavior between `wp-expert` and `wp-contributor`. |
| Hard-code a universal web-search count for every task | No | Reject | Correct budget depends on risk, drift, source quality, and whether local repo facts already answer the question. |

## Meta Handbook Expertise Addition

### Objective

Strengthen `wp-contributor` with focused Meta Handbook expertise for WordPress.org, WordCamp.org, Make sites, project routing, Meta Trac, project-specific GitHub repositories, SVN/Git patch flow, local environments, Slack escalation, contributor-day work, docs/testing contribution paths, privacy, cache, and admin/access boundaries.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expanded Meta workflow reference | Yes | Add | Meta contribution work spans WordPress.org properties, WordCamp.org, Make sites, directories, profiles, badges, handbooks, and infrastructure with different rules than Core or Gutenberg. |
| Official Meta Handbook anchors | Yes | Add | The handbook is the current source for scope, projects, setup, Git, SVN, Slack, and access guidance. |
| Project routing checklist | Yes | Add | Meta work can live in Meta Trac, project GitHub repos, SVN/Git mirrors, handbook pages, or project-specific environments. |
| Local environment guidance | Yes | Add | The handbook covers older VVV/WordPress Meta Environment paths, newer project-bundled environments, and Dockerized project environments; the skill must not assume one setup fits all projects. |
| Git/SVN patch discipline | Yes | Add | Meta projects are historically SVN-backed and often use Git locally with Trac patches, so patch root, `trunk`, and comment etiquette matter. |
| Access/admin boundaries | Yes | Add | GitHub organization, SVN, Slack, and app/admin changes require documented permissions and should be routed rather than promised. |
| Privacy/cache/deployment review points | Yes | Add | WordPress.org properties include profiles, badges, event data, moderation data, directories, search, navigation, and caches with public impact. |
| Copy the whole Meta Handbook | No | Reject | The handbook changes; the skill should provide a compact playbook and official anchors rather than duplicate full pages. |

## Production Dependency Discipline Addition

### Objective

Add explicit shared expertise so both `wp-expert` and `wp-contributor` never ship development-specific Composer or npm packages to production while still allowing dev dependencies in source manifests, lockfiles, local environments, and CI build/test stages.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared production dependency reference | Yes | Add | Composer/npm production artifact rules apply to both client/product delivery and official contribution work, so shared guidance prevents drift. |
| Composer `require-dev` boundary | Yes | Add | Production `vendor/` must be created from `composer install --no-dev`; dev tools must not be runtime dependencies. |
| npm `devDependencies` boundary | Yes | Add | WordPress plugin/theme artifacts should ship built JS/CSS, not build/test tooling or `node_modules` unless explicitly required. |
| Runtime artifact checklist | Yes | Add | The rule must be validated at packaging/deploy time, not just stated in dependency manifests. |
| Skill router wiring in both skills | Yes | Add | Codex needs to load the same reference from either WordPress engineering or WordPress contribution mode. |
| Build/deploy and contribution validation reminders | Yes | Add | The rule is most likely to be missed in release, CI, deployment, and upstream packaging reviews. |
| Delete dev dependencies from source manifests | No | Reject | Dev dependencies are correct for local development and CI; the risk is shipping them in runtime artifacts. |
| Ban lockfiles because they mention dev packages | No | Reject | Lockfiles support reproducible builds and may record dev packages without installing them in production artifacts. |

## WordPress.org Release Operations Lessons Addition

### Objective

Add focused `wp-expert` expertise from the WordPress.org release lessons: SVN-first verification, production-only Composer vendor handling, first SVN commit timeout behavior, Plugin Check workflow fallback, 10up deploy rerun behavior, GitHub ZIP continuation, workflow modernization backlog, and `.wordpress-org` asset verification.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated WordPress.org release operations reference | Yes | Add | These lessons are operational and release-specific; a focused reference avoids bloating generic deployment or plugin-guideline files. |
| SVN-first release verification | Yes | Add | GitHub Actions can fail after the server-side SVN commit completed, so direct SVN checks prevent false rollback or retag decisions. |
| Verify `trunk/`, `tags/<version>/`, and `assets/` | Yes | Add | WordPress.org release state spans current trunk, immutable version tags, and plugin directory assets. |
| Production `vendor/` nuance | Yes | Add | WordPress.org users will not run Composer, so runtime Composer dependencies must ship, but only from production install boundaries. |
| First SVN commit timeout guidance | Yes | Add | Initial releases can add trunk, tag, assets, built files, and production vendor at once; timeout after data transfer is inconclusive. |
| 10up deploy rerun behavior | Yes | Add | If the tag already exists after a timeout, rerunning may no-op deploy and continue later release steps like GitHub ZIP upload. |
| Plugin Check explicit fallback | Yes | Add | `wordpress/plugin-check-action@v1` was unstable in the observed runner/Node setup; explicit Plugin Check with Node `24.15.0` and `@wordpress/env@11.6.0` is recorded as a proven fallback. |
| Workflow modernization backlog | Yes | Add | Deprecated `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` and nested action warnings should be tracked without blocking a verified release. |
| Treat observed Node/action versions as permanent global truth | No | Reject | They are project-proven release lessons, but future workflow modernization should revalidate current maintained versions. |

## Design-To-FSE Custom Block Theme Addition

### Objective

Strengthen `wp-expert` for building custom block-based Full Site Editing themes from provided designs, with modular admin-editable architecture, core-block-first mapping, no Custom HTML/Shortcode blocks for new design implementation, and clear rules for when a custom block is actually necessary.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated design-to-FSE reference | Yes | Add | The existing theme guidance lacked a concrete workflow for translating visual designs into editable block theme architecture. |
| Design-to-theme audit | Yes | Add | A successful FSE build needs templates, parts, patterns, tokens, content model, and interactions mapped before implementation. |
| Block mapping ladder | Yes | Add | Core blocks, `theme.json`, patterns, template parts, block styles, and variations should be exhausted before creating custom blocks. |
| No Custom HTML/Shortcode blocks rule | Yes | Add | These blocks undermine admin editability, validation, accessibility, and maintainability for new design implementation. |
| Custom block decision matrix | Yes | Add | Custom blocks are still needed for structured editing, dynamic data, interactions, constrained repeaters, and stable semantics. |
| Admin editability model | Yes | Add | The skill now distinguishes templates, template parts, patterns, synced patterns, locking, allowed blocks, and inspector/document settings. |
| Theme file architecture and validation checklist | Yes | Add | Durable FSE builds need clear file locations, editor/frontend parity checks, responsive QA, a11y checks, and release packaging checks. |
| Force every unique design section into a custom block | No | Reject | Many sections should be patterns or block styles so editors can keep using native WordPress controls. |
| Allow raw HTML or shortcodes for speed | No | Reject | It may appear faster, but it creates brittle, non-native, less editable themes and defeats the FSE goal. |

## Security And Performance Expertise Expansion

### Objective

Deepen `wp-expert` security and performance behavior for enterprise and WP VIP-style projects where sensitive endpoints, high-traffic pages, admin/editor performance, and production reliability require explicit threat models, measurable budgets, and negative tests.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated security threat-modeling reference | Yes | Add | The existing hardening checklist was useful but too compressed for high-risk REST/admin/upload/webhook/OAuth/MCP work. |
| Dedicated performance profiling and budgets reference | Yes | Add | Enterprise performance work needs baseline, budget, measurement, hot-path profiling, and re-measurement discipline. |
| Keep `performance-and-security.md` as quick triage | Yes | Keep and route | This preserves token efficiency while giving agents a deeper path when risk requires it. |
| Add test recipes for negative security cases | Yes | Add | Security work is not complete if denied, malformed, wrong-owner, replay, and redaction cases are untested. |
| Add performance review output template | Yes | Add | Performance findings need path, trigger, evidence, impact, fix, and BC risk rather than generic "optimize" advice. |
| Add hard-coded universal performance SLA values | No | Reject | Budgets must be calibrated to route, host, data volume, and project goals; the reference uses review triggers and measurement workflow. |

## Test Coverage Discipline Addition

### Objective

Add focused `wp-expert` expertise so every implementation, PR, or review makes an explicit test-coverage decision, adds or updates tests when behavior risk warrants it, and treats missing coverage as a concrete review finding when a realistic regression could affect users, security, data, scale, editor behavior, or releases.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated test coverage discipline reference | Yes | Add | Existing guidance said tests matter, but did not force a per-change decision or missing-coverage review behavior. |
| Risk-calibrated test need gate | Yes | Add | Not every docs/CSS/value change needs automated tests; behavior, security, data, API, migration, cache, editor, and release risks do. |
| Coverage selection by change type | Yes | Add | Future agents need to pick PHPUnit, Brain Monkey, WP integration, JS unit, e2e, visual, or runtime validation based on risk. |
| PR checklist for tests added/omitted | Yes | Add | PRs should explain tests added, existing coverage, commands run, or why tests were not needed. |
| Missing coverage review severity | Yes | Add | Missing tests should be findings only when tied to concrete regressions, with severity based on impact. |
| Require tests for every single textual or exact-value change | No | Reject | This would waste effort and contradict risk-calibrated validation for direct user-fed edits. |

## Database Table Architecture Review Addition

### Objective

Add focused `wp-expert` expertise for reviewing custom database table architecture from performance, scalability, maintainability, WordPress portability, migration, multisite, retention, privacy, and data-integrity standpoints.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated custom table architecture reference | Yes | Add | Table review is broader than query performance; it needs schema ownership, lifecycle, migrations, retention, and maintainability guidance. |
| Query-to-index mapping checklist | Yes | Add | Enterprise review must prove indexes match real read paths rather than guessed columns. |
| Migration and lifecycle guidance | Yes | Add | Activation, upgrades, backfills, uninstall, and launched schema compatibility are common production failure points. |
| Multisite and `$wpdb->prefix` guidance | Yes | Add | Per-site vs network/global table choices are expensive to change later and affect cache keys, unique keys, exports, and repair commands. |
| Repository/query layer maintainability rules | Yes | Add | Custom table code becomes hard to maintain when raw SQL is scattered across controllers, cron, REST, and templates. |
| Force every custom table to use database foreign keys | No | Reject | WordPress portability and core table behavior make application-level integrity, cleanup hooks, and repair tooling safer by default. |

## UX Product Strategy And Design QA Addition

### Objective

Add first-class `wp-expert` expertise for understanding and implementing UI/UX at a premium enterprise standard, including UX discovery, user journeys, information architecture, UX writing, conversion flows, usability review, design-system governance, and pixel-faithful implementation when the user provides an image, screenshot, Figma frame, or approved mockup.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated UX product strategy and design QA reference | Yes | Add | Existing UI guidance covered implementation quality, but not enough upstream discovery, IA, content design, conversion, or design QA discipline. |
| Premium/enterprise feel rubric | Yes | Add | Future UI work needs a concrete quality bar for typography, spacing, layout, density, color, components, motion, brand fit, WordPress fit, and engineering fit. |
| Image/screenshot/mockup matching rules | Yes | Add | When a design is supplied, the agent should treat it as the visual source of truth, target pixel-faithful parity, and document justified deviations. |
| UX writing and content design coverage | Yes | Add | Labels, helper text, empty states, errors, success messages, and confirmations materially affect enterprise product quality. |
| Conversion and funnel UX guidance | Yes | Add | WordPress work often includes marketing, checkout, pricing, onboarding, and lead flows where task completion and trust matter. |
| Usability testing and heuristic severity model | Yes | Add | Reviews need to distinguish blockers from polish and tie UX issues to task completion, data loss, accessibility, or trust impact. |
| Force pixel perfection over accessibility or maintainability | No | Reject | Pixel parity matters, but not at the cost of accessibility, responsive behavior, editor editability, performance, semantic markup, or long-term maintainability. |

## Enterprise WordPress Gap Expansion

### Objective

Implement all identified gaps for WordPress plugin development, theme development, troubleshooting/debugging, conversion-focused website development, and VIP/enterprise delivery standards without bloating `SKILL.md`. The update adds focused routed references so future agents can load only the expertise needed for each task.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin product architecture reference | Yes | Add | Enterprise plugins need safe extension contracts, add-on/pro boundaries, feature flags, diagnostics contracts, and launched public API discipline beyond basic module layout. |
| Plugin supportability reference | Yes | Add | Serious client work needs Site Health checks, redacted diagnostics, support exports, correlation IDs, log levels, and safe recovery controls. |
| Advanced troubleshooting decision tree | Yes | Add | Production debugging benefits from symptom-to-probe matrices, conflict isolation, cache/CDN diagnosis, REST/auth triage, and rollback-first mitigation. |
| Conversion-focused website engineering | Yes | Add | CRO-grade WordPress builds need offer clarity, CTA strategy, trust proof, form friction reduction, checkout/lead funnel quality, SEO, accessibility, performance, and measurement. |
| Analytics and measurement engineering | Yes | Add | Conversion work is incomplete without consent-aware tracking, duplicate-event prevention, privacy boundaries, and validation without production pollution. |
| Theme frontend performance quality gate | Yes | Add | Theme work needs explicit Core Web Vitals, fonts, images, asset scoping, CLS/LCP/INP, block CSS bloat, and frontend/editor CSS checks. |
| VIP enterprise launch readiness matrix | Yes | Add | Enterprise launches need go/no-go checks across code, data, cache, search, redirects, observability, rollback, support, and post-launch monitoring. |
| Hybrid theme migration modernization | Yes | Add | Classic-to-block, page-builder-to-block, child-theme cleanup, WooCommerce template modernization, and SEO/content preservation require a dedicated migration playbook. |
| Enterprise acceptance criteria templates | Yes | Add | Implementation drift is reduced when plugin, theme, REST, migration, performance, security, and conversion work has explicit definition-of-done gates. |
| Put all guidance into existing files only | No | Reject | Existing files are already broad; separate references preserve token efficiency and make routing more deterministic. |

## Thinking And Anti-Overengineering Discipline Addition

### Objective

Make brainstorming convergence, planning discipline, premium/enterprise polish stopping rules, anti-overengineering gates, and token-conscious reference loading explicit without bloating `SKILL.md` or duplicating the same rules across many references.

| Dedicated thinking and anti-overengineering reference | Yes | Add | It gives future agents one place to calibrate thinking effort, option count, polish depth, and abstraction decisions. |
| Bounded brainstorming rule | Yes | Add | Forces a recommendation and next validation step instead of open-ended idea generation. |
| Premium polish stopping rule | Yes | Add | Preserves premium/enterprise feel while preventing subjective polish from expanding the current task. |
| Reference-loading exception by named risk | Yes | Add | Keeps the default token budget small while allowing deeper loading only when a concrete acceptance risk requires it. |
| Acceptance criteria calibration | Yes | Add | Prevents template-completion theater and keeps done criteria proportional to the risk. |
| Put more rules directly in `SKILL.md` | No | Reject | The skill should remain a compact router; the deeper behavior belongs in a selectively loaded reference. |

## Skill Token Budget Optimization

### Objective

Reduce baseline token usage after recent skill expansions by shrinking always-loaded skill metadata, keeping `SKILL.md` hot paths concise, and adding an automated guard so future improvements do not quietly increase profile-level context cost.

### Findings

- `wp-expert` frontmatter had grown into a capability catalog, which increases skill-selection context even before the skill body is loaded.
- `wp-expert/SKILL.md` had enough embedded routing detail that every WordPress invocation paid for capabilities that should live in the routed reference map.
- Agent `default_prompt` values repeated the same long capability catalog and created another easy-to-grow surface.
- No validation script enforced metadata or hot-path body budgets, so useful skill additions could accidentally regress token efficiency.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short frontmatter descriptions | Yes | Add | Frontmatter is the highest-leverage place to save baseline tokens while preserving skill trigger intent. |
| Shorter `wp-expert` router body | Yes | Add | The detailed task matrix already lives in `reference-routing-map.md`; duplicating it in `SKILL.md` wastes every invocation. |
| Short agent default prompts | Yes | Add | UI/default prompts should guide invocation, not mirror full coverage. |
| Automated token budget audit | Yes | Add | Prevents future expansions from silently pushing baseline token usage back up. |
| Delete routed references | No | Reject | References are only loaded when needed and are the right place for deep expertise. |

## Project Subagent Routing And Milestone PR Base Addition

### Objective

Improve skill-level routing so large WordPress and contribution projects can use project `.codex/agents/*.toml` subagents efficiently, especially `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, while keeping the parent agent responsible for planning, validation, commits, pushes, and PRs. Add an explicit issue-milestone gate so issue-driven PRs target the matching release branch instead of drifting to `main` or `trunk`.

### Standout Decision Review

| Addition | Will it stand out? | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared project subagent routing reference | Yes | Add | Keeps model routing and subagent usage reusable across `wp-expert` and `wp-contributor` without bloating hot-path skill bodies. |
| Project-level `.codex/agents/*.toml` profiles | Yes | Add | Subagent needs differ per app/repo; project config is the right boundary for mapper, reviewer, and narrow fixer roles. |
| `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` routing guidance | Yes | Add | Encourages Spark for bounded read-only mapping, log triage, narrow fixes, and validation summaries while reserving stronger models for high-risk decisions. |
| Hooks as dynamic skill router | No | Reject | Hooks are deterministic lifecycle scripts; they should enforce project checks, not choose WordPress expertise or model assignment. |
| Issue milestone to PR base gate | Yes | Add | Prevents new-chat drift where issue work incorrectly opens PRs against default branch instead of the release branch tied to the milestone. |

### Added Artifacts

- `shared/references/project-subagent-routing.md`

### Updated Artifacts

- `wp-expert/SKILL.md`: added shared subagent routing to operating rules and hot-path shortcuts.
- `wp-contributor/SKILL.md`: added shared subagent routing for contribution repos.
- `shared/references/session-continuity-pr-discipline.md`: added issue milestone to PR base branch gate.
- `wp-expert/references/reference-routing-map.md`: added subagent/model routing and issue-milestone PR routing signals.
- `README.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `skill-evals/wp-expert-scenarios.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`: documented and evaluated the new behavior.
- `scripts/validate-references.sh`: now accepts routing-map references that live in `shared/references/`.
- `scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh`: now symlinks `shared/` into Codex and Claude skill roots so `../shared/references/*.md` resolves from global skill installs.
