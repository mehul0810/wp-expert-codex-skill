# Content Writer Router

Use this router after `content-writer` is selected. Load one primary reference, then at most one shared support reference when current research or context risk requires it.

## Primary Routes

- SEO, AEO, GEO, AI Overviews, content briefs, search intent, schema-aware copy, and content refreshes: `organic-search-content.md`.
- Voice-preserving edits or evidence-based detection of generic AI-writing patterns: `human-writing-quality-gate.md`.
- Enterprise product pages, buyer-facing messaging, security/privacy copy, case studies, comparisons, and WordPress VIP positioning: `enterprise-product-writing.md`.

## Selection Rules

- Do not load the editorial gate during research-only work.
- Do not force enterprise tone onto founder writing, community support, ordinary documentation, or general informational content.
- For a mixed enterprise landing page, use enterprise product writing as primary and load the editorial gate only for a final pass when generic prose is a confirmed risk.
- Keep implementation in `wp-site-expert`; this skill owns the content artifact.
