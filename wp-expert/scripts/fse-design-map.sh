# FSE Design Map

## Metadata

- Project:
- Theme slug:
- Design source:
- Date:
- Prepared by:
- Source classification (exact, directional, inspiration):
- Source dimensions and intended viewport:
- Source/candidate screenshot paths:

## Evidence Confidence

- Supplied facts:
- Measured values:
- Inferred values:
- Decisions or unresolved uncertainty:

## Visual Region Measurements

- Region/hierarchy map:
- Widths, gaps, alignment, and layering:
- Typography and font-loading evidence:
- Colors, borders, radii, and shadows:
- Desktop-to-mobile behavior (supplied/inferred/decision needed):

## Templates

- Required templates:
- Priority templates for milestone 1:
- CPT or WooCommerce templates:

## Ownership Map

- Theme-owned presentation:
- Plugin-owned durable functionality/data:
- Post content:
- Post meta/options:
- External data sources:
- Synced/global editor-owned content:

## Admin Editing Surface

- Primary editing surface (Pages > Edit, Site Editor, synced pattern, option page, CPT, external data):
- Visible content source of truth (`post_content`, template, part, pattern, meta, option, API):
- Templates that must render Post Content:
- Page content seeding plan (manual, WP-CLI, import, migration, none):
- Site Editor database override policy:
- Locked areas vs editor-editable areas:

## Template Parts

- Header variants:
- Footer variants:
- Reusable global sections:

## Patterns

- Core section patterns:
- Synced patterns:
- Unsynced patterns:

## Tokens (`theme.json`)

- Color palette:
- Typography scale:
- Spacing scale:
- Layout widths (`contentSize`, `wideSize`):
- Radius, border, shadow, motion:

## Content Model

- Static content fields:
- Dynamic data fields:
- Global reusable content:
- Query-driven sections:

## Asset Inventory

- Supplied/reused assets:
- Missing assets:
- Generate/source/license/placeholder decisions:
- Asset briefs and approval state:
- Crops, focal points, aspect ratios, responsive variants:
- Provenance, alt-text intent, formats, dimensions, optimization:

## Block Mapping Ladder

- Solved with content model/data contract:
- Solved with `theme.json`:
- Solved with templates/template parts:
- Solved with patterns:
- Solved with core blocks:
- Solved with block bindings:
- Solved with block styles or variations:
- Requires custom block with InnerBlocks (justify each):
- Requires custom dynamic block (justify each):
- Requires Interactivity API behavior:

## Custom Block Decisions

- Static vs dynamic rendering:
- Attributes vs meta/options/data source:
- InnerBlocks allowed blocks/template/locking:
- Parent/ancestor/child relationships:
- Deprecation or migration strategy:
- Editor preview and empty states:

## Editor Surface Plan

- Document-level settings (document/sidebar panels):
- Block-level settings (inspector panels):
- Classic editor-only meta boxes (if legacy support is needed):

## Interaction and UX States

- Navigation behavior:
- Form states:
- Empty/loading/error states:
- Animation and reduced-motion behavior:

## Validation Matrix

- Breakpoints:
- Pages > Edit controls visible page-owned content:
- Site Editor controls only intended template/part/global content:
- Editor/frontend parity targets:
- Accessibility checks:
- Performance checks:
- Matched viewport/zoom/content/font/data state:
- Overlay or perceptual-diff method:
- Region-level parity tolerance:
- Accepted, constrained, and unresolved deviations:

## Open Risks

- Risk:
- Mitigation:
