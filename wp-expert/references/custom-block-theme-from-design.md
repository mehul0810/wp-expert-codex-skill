# Custom Block Theme From Design

Use this when converting a Figma/static/brand design into a custom block-based Full Site Editing theme that stays modular, editable from WordPress admin, visually faithful, and maintainable without using Custom HTML or Shortcode blocks for new design implementation. Read `block-theme-architecture.md` first when the task involves non-trivial block, pattern, template, data, or interaction decisions.

## Non-Negotiables

- Build the theme around the Site Editor model: `theme.json`, templates, template parts, patterns, core blocks, block supports, and custom blocks only when necessary.
- Decide theme vs plugin ownership before building: presentation belongs in the theme; durable data, business rules, and cross-theme functionality usually belong in plugins.
- Do not use Custom HTML blocks or Shortcode blocks to implement new design sections. Treat them as legacy containment only and flag them as technical debt.
- Keep admin editability explicit. Editors should be able to update content, images, buttons, navigation, global styles, template parts, and reusable sections without editing code.
- Preserve design intent through tokens, layout rules, patterns, and editor constraints, not by freezing the entire page into one custom block or hard-coded markup.
- Validate editor and frontend parity; a design that only works on the frontend is not a finished block theme.

## Design-To-Theme Audit

Before implementation, create a design map:

- Ownership: what belongs to theme files, plugin functionality, post content, post meta, options, synced patterns, or external data.
- Templates: `front-page`, `home`, `index`, `page`, `single`, `archive`, `search`, `404`, CPT templates, WooCommerce templates, and landing-page variants.
- Template parts: header, footer, navigation, sidebar, loop sections, CTA bands, newsletter/signup, social proof, and reusable global sections.
- Patterns: hero, feature grid, card list, stats, testimonials, logos, CTA, pricing, FAQ, media split, post grid, author block, and page sections.
- Tokens: color palette, gradients, typography scale, fluid sizes, spacing scale, content width, wide width, radii, shadows, borders, motion, and breakpoint behavior.
- Content model: editable text, images, links, buttons, navigation, query-driven content, reusable global content, site options, post meta, and dynamic data.
- Interaction model: menus, tabs, accordions, sliders, filtering, search, forms, modals, and animation requirements.

## Block Mapping Ladder

Use the first layer that satisfies design fidelity, editability, accessibility, and maintainability:

1. `theme.json`: global styles, presets, layout sizes, block settings, spacing, typography, color, shadows, borders, custom properties, template part registration, and style variations.
2. Core blocks: Group, Row, Stack, Columns, Cover, Media & Text, Image, Gallery, Heading, Paragraph, Buttons, Navigation, Site Logo, Site Title, Query Loop, Post Template, Post Terms, Featured Image, Template Part, and Post Content.
3. Block bindings: bind supported core block attributes to post meta, post data, term data, pattern overrides, or custom binding sources when the need is dynamic data mapping, not a full custom editing UI.
4. Block supports and styles: spacing, dimensions, layout, color, typography, border, shadow, alignment, block style variations, and scoped CSS for gaps that `theme.json` cannot express cleanly.
5. Patterns: reusable section markup in `/patterns`, pattern categories, clear titles, viewport width metadata, and starter layouts editors can insert and modify.
6. Template parts and templates: reusable block markup in `/parts` and top-level templates in `/templates`; register parts in `theme.json` so they appear cleanly in the Site Editor.
7. Block variations or block styles: use when a core block can handle the content model but needs a named preset or controlled variation.
8. Custom block with `InnerBlocks`: use when the design needs safe composition with controlled child blocks, templates, parent/ancestor rules, or locking.
9. Custom dynamic block: use when rendering depends on server data, permissions, query state, integrations, or evolving markup.
10. Interactivity API: use for frontend behavior that needs stateful interactions while staying aligned with WordPress block rendering.

## When To Create A Custom Block

Create a custom block when at least one is true:

- The design needs a structured content model that core blocks cannot enforce without fragile layout editing.
- The section renders dynamic data from posts, terms, users, external APIs, options, or custom tables.
- The interaction requires purpose-built controls, accessible behavior, or frontend scripts that should not be hand-assembled by editors.
- The design needs constrained repeaters, nested items, allowed child blocks, custom previews, or dynamic server rendering.
- The markup must stay stable across redesigns and cannot rely on user-edited raw HTML.

Do not create a custom block when:

- A pattern made of core blocks can satisfy the section.
- A core block plus Block Bindings can satisfy the data model with stable editor UX.
- The only gap is spacing, color, border, radius, shadow, or responsive behavior that can be solved with `theme.json`, block supports, block styles, or scoped CSS.
- The block would simply wrap a hard-coded design with no meaningful editor controls.
- The only purpose is to mimic a static design that could be represented by a locked pattern or a variation of core blocks.
- A shortcode or Custom HTML block is being used to avoid proper block/theme architecture.

## Block Bindings Guidance

- Use Block Bindings for dynamic text/media/link/date fields that map cleanly to supported core block attributes and keep the editing surface native.
- Register source data with explicit schema and permissions. For post meta sources, expose only intended keys and keep sensitive keys unbound.
- Validate compatibility per WordPress version and supported block attributes before committing to bindings as the primary model.
- Promote a custom block only when bindings cannot support required structure, editorial constraints, or interaction semantics.

## Admin Editability Model

- Use templates for page-level structure and template parts for global or repeated site regions.
- Use patterns as section starters that editors can insert, duplicate, and modify.
- Use synced patterns only for content that should update globally across the site; use unsynced theme patterns for reusable design sections.
- Use block locking, allowed blocks, InnerBlocks templates, and template locking to protect layout while preserving content editability.
- Prefer document/sidebar panels for document-level settings and inspector controls for block-specific settings.
- Keep classic editor meta boxes out of the block editor unless preserving a legacy compatibility contract.
- When classic editor support requires meta boxes, register/show them for classic screens and keep them hidden in the block editor UI.

## Theme File Architecture

A custom block theme should usually include:

```text
theme-slug/
  style.css
  theme.json
  functions.php
  templates/
  parts/
  patterns/
  styles/
  assets/
  src/
  build/
```

Guidelines:

- Keep `functions.php` thin: setup, asset registration, pattern categories, block styles/variations, and custom block registration.
- Put reusable section markup in `/patterns`, not hard-coded page templates unless it is structural.
- Put global regions in `/parts`, directly under the folder; WordPress does not support nested template parts.
- Use `/styles` for global style variations when alternate design skins are required.
- Keep custom block source and build artifacts organized so release packaging includes runtime assets but not dev tooling.

## CSS And Responsive Strategy

- Encode design tokens in `theme.json` first; use CSS only for what the style engine and block supports cannot express safely.
- Use layout presets, `contentSize`, `wideSize`, spacing scale, and fluid typography before custom wrappers.
- Build mobile-first. Avoid fixed heights and absolute positioning unless the design truly requires them and responsive states are verified.
- Scope CSS to block classes, pattern wrapper classes, or theme utility classes; avoid global CSS that changes core block behavior unexpectedly.
- Check editor canvas, Site Editor, preview, and frontend at mobile, tablet, laptop, and wide breakpoints.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Create the design map and ownership map.
2. Define content contracts and dynamic data sources before block markup.
3. Build `theme.json` tokens and settings before page markup.
4. Create the minimum template hierarchy and template parts.
5. Prototype sections in the editor with core blocks and copy stable block markup into `/patterns`, `/templates`, or `/parts`.
6. Add block styles/variations/bindings for repeatable design and data needs.
7. Build custom blocks only where the decision matrix proves core blocks, patterns, variations, and bindings are insufficient.
8. For custom blocks, decide static vs dynamic rendering, attributes vs meta/options/data sources, `InnerBlocks` constraints, and deprecation strategy.
9. Add Interactivity API behavior only when frontend interaction requires state.
10. Add visual parity checks for editor canvas, Site Editor preview, and frontend render states across breakpoints.
11. Validate editor editability, frontend fidelity, responsive behavior, accessibility, performance, and release packaging.

## Validation Checklist

- No new Custom HTML or Shortcode blocks are used for design implementation.
- Editors can update expected content and global sections from the admin/Site Editor.
- Header, footer, navigation, templates, template parts, and patterns appear with clear labels.
- Core block patterns remain valid; no invalid block warnings appear after save/reload.
- Editor canvas, frontend, and preview match within acceptable design tolerance.
- Dynamic fields mapped through Block Bindings render correctly in editor and frontend with expected empty/error states.
- Custom blocks can be inserted, edited, saved, reloaded, copied, transformed when supported, and rendered without validation warnings.
- Interactive blocks degrade safely and load scripts only where needed.
- Mobile, tablet, desktop, and wide layouts are verified.
- Keyboard navigation, focus states, landmarks, headings, alt text, contrast, and reduced motion are checked.
- Query Loop and dynamic content states cover empty, long content, missing image, and translated text.
- Custom blocks include tests or at least targeted editor/frontend smoke checks.
- Release artifact includes built assets and excludes development-only Composer/npm packages.
