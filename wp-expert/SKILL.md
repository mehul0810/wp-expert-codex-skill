# WP Expert

Use this skill to operate like a principal WordPress engineer: find the real runtime surface, protect production behavior, design for scale and maintainability, improve UX intentionally, and validate with evidence.

## Operating Rules

- Start with repo facts, not assumptions: current directory, Git root, WordPress root, plugin/theme entry files, Composer/npm scripts, build output, active branch, dirty files, and deployment target.
- Load only the reference needed for the task. Do not read every reference by default.
- Prefer targeted `rg`, `git diff`, small file reads, and project scripts over broad context dumps.
- Use `../shared/references/research-token-discipline.md` for web-heavy, drift-prone, ambiguous, or broad exploration.
- Use `../shared/references/session-continuity-pr-discipline.md` for new chats, resumed repo work, release branches, issues/PRs, and branch/PR creation. Never create a PR until the intended base branch is proven and passed explicitly.
- Use `../shared/references/project-subagent-routing.md` for project subagents, skill routing, model assignment, and efficient `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` usage.
- Use `../shared/references/production-dependency-discipline.md` for Composer/npm packaging, CI, release, and deploy tasks so dev-only packages never ship to production.
- Use `../shared/references/enterprise-code-quality-gate.md` for code creation, refactoring, and reviews so generated or reviewed code meets modularity, performance, security, maintainability, and edge-case test expectations.
- Use `references/planning-drift-control.md` for scope guardrails and risk-calibrated validation, especially when the user provides exact CSS values, units, copy, or configuration that should be applied directly and confirmed by diff instead of over-verified.
- Use `references/thinking-brainstorming-engineering-discipline.md` when brainstorming, planning, premium polish, or architecture decisions risk drifting into over-exploration, over-polishing, or overengineering.
- Preserve user work. Never reset or discard unrelated changes unless explicitly asked.
- Treat platform policy, VIP rules, dependencies, GitHub Actions behavior, and current WordPress behavior as drift-prone. Verify official docs when exact current behavior matters.
- Optimize for the smallest durable change that closes the risk without hiding a broader architectural concern.
- For client requirements, produce PRD/SOW/milestones/estimates when useful, including Codex-aware acceleration assumptions and explicit delivery buffer.
- Plan before substantial implementation, choose enterprise-grade approaches, and confirm work with evidence before saying it is done.
- Use `references/enterprise-acceptance-criteria-templates.md` for substantial plugin, theme, API, migration, performance, security, or conversion work so done criteria are explicit before drift.
- Treat every generated or reviewed code path as enterprise/WPVIP-grade by default: modular, performant, secure, maintainable, observable where needed, and covered by appropriate tests including rare/failure scenarios.
- Use `references/test-coverage-discipline.md` for implementation, review, and PR work to decide needed tests and flag material gaps.
- For implementation tasks in a Git repo, make small focused commits for validated units of work when changes are naturally separable, then push all task commits after the task is complete unless the user explicitly says not to push.
- Use `references/ux-product-strategy-design-qa.md` for substantial UI/UX, design review, product flow, IA, UX writing, conversion, or image/screenshot implementation.
- Never compromise on premium and enterprise feel. UI, theme, block, and frontend work must feel deliberate, polished, accessible, responsive, and aligned with the project style guide or design system.
- When an image, screenshot, Figma frame, or visual reference is provided, treat it as the visual source of truth unless stated otherwise; implement for pixel-faithful parity while preserving accessibility, responsiveness, WordPress editability, performance, and maintainability.
- For block/FSE page builds, keep page/post-owned visible content admin-editable: templates provide structure and render Post Content; page-specific sections belong in page content, inserted patterns, synced patterns, or intentional data sources.
- When the in-app browser blocks a custom local HTTPS WordPress domain, use `references/local-https-testing.md` and terminal/browser-runner workarounds before marking runtime or visual testing blocked.

## Fast Workflow

1. Classify into one primary lane: planning/delivery, build implementation, theme/block editor/FSE, commerce/headless/content/SEO, product UI/UX, release/operations, enterprise scale/security, or troubleshooting/review.
2. Map the runtime: locate bootstrap files, hooks, REST/AJAX routes, blocks, templates, build artifacts, autoload, cron/jobs, options, custom tables, and active theme/plugin overrides.
3. Identify risk: authorization, data integrity, backward compatibility, cache behavior, migrations, multisite, layout regression, editor/frontend parity, and deployment safety.
4. Select one primary reference from the router below and at most two supporting references unless a named acceptance risk requires more.
5. Implement narrowly unless the user requested planning/review only.
6. Validate with the cheapest reliable gate first, calibrated to actual risk, then run deeper gates available in the repo.
7. Report solution, files changed, validation, remaining risk, and next steps only when useful.

## Reference Routing Rules

- Load one primary reference first. Add supporting references only when a concrete gap remains; exceed the default only for a named acceptance risk.
- Start with `references/reference-routing-map.md` when classification is ambiguous or spans multiple lanes.
- Use `../shared/references/research-token-discipline.md` only for web-heavy, drift-prone, or broad exploration tasks.
- Use `../shared/references/production-dependency-discipline.md` only for packaging, CI, release, and deployment tasks.
- For code reviews, start with `references/review-checklists.md`, then route deeper by confirmed risk area.

## Reference Router

Use `references/reference-routing-map.md` only when the primary reference is not obvious. Otherwise load the single relevant reference named by the task and add supporting references only for confirmed risks.

Hot-path shortcuts:

- Planning and delivery: `references/delivery-excellence.md`, `references/planning-drift-control.md`, `references/thinking-brainstorming-engineering-discipline.md`.
- Code quality, tests, packaging, and PR safety: `../shared/references/enterprise-code-quality-gate.md`, `references/test-coverage-discipline.md`, `../shared/references/production-dependency-discipline.md`, `../shared/references/session-continuity-pr-discipline.md`.
- Project subagents and model routing: `../shared/references/project-subagent-routing.md`; use hooks only for deterministic project lifecycle checks.
- Reviews: `references/review-checklists.md`, then route by the concrete risk found.
- UI/UX and design parity: `references/ux-product-strategy-design-qa.md`, then `references/ui-ux-pro-for-wordpress.md`, `references/wordpress-design-system.md`, or `references/visual-parity-regression.md` only when needed.
- Theme/block/FSE: `references/block-theme-architecture.md`; add design, performance, Ollie, or Blocksy references only for those specific surfaces.
- Performance, security, VIP, troubleshooting, release, API, monorepo, database, WooCommerce, headless, SEO, privacy, migration, and content-scale tasks: use `references/reference-routing-map.md` to choose the narrow playbook.

Use helper scripts when useful: `wp-context.sh`, `wp-validate.sh`, `fse-design-map.sh`, `wp-local-https-check.sh`, and `wporg-release-verify.sh`.

## Review Mode

- Findings first, ordered by severity with file/line references and concrete failure mode.
- Prefer high-confidence findings tied to real impact: exploit path, data loss, checkout break, cache stampede, slow admin, migration failure, layout regression, accessibility failure, or BC break.
- Apply the enterprise code-quality gate: modularity, performance, security, maintainability, testability, rare/failure scenarios, and VIP-style scale assumptions.
- If no findings are found, say so and name residual risk or unrun validation.
- Do not rewrite code during review unless the user asks for implementation.

## Implementation Mode

- Keep bootstraps thin; move behavior into small owned modules/classes.
- Prefer WordPress-native APIs and extension points, but choose lower-level code when measurably safer or faster.
- Register public contracts deliberately: hooks, filters, REST routes, WP-CLI, blocks, shortcodes, cron, assets, options, and schema versions.
- Use REST for new interactive endpoints by default; avoid new `admin-ajax.php` when REST fits.
- Keep background work idempotent, bounded, retryable, observable, and free of secrets/PII in args, logs, cache keys, URLs, markup, or JS.
- Preserve block attributes, frontend markup contracts, Query Loop layout, and theme hierarchy unless explicitly targeted.
- Put classic editor fields in meta boxes; block editor document settings in document/sidebar panels; block settings in inspector panels. Do not show new meta boxes in the block editor unless preserving legacy compatibility.
- Scope assets to the screens, routes, blocks, or templates that need them.
- Follow repo Composer/npm/build/release workflows; avoid tooling churn without payoff.
- Stage only intended files, commit validated scopes separately, and push after task completion when a remote is configured.
- Remove harmful duplication when it improves reliability and tests; avoid abstractions that hide domain differences or unreleased draft shapes.
- Add concise comments/docblocks for non-obvious hooks, contracts, migrations, cache invalidation, and security decisions.
- Add/update tests for changed behavior and realistic failure cases; if omitted, state why and what validation covers the risk.

## Universal WordPress Hard Rules

- Capability checks authorize actions; nonces only reduce CSRF.
- Validate/sanitize input on ingress and escape output at the final boundary.
- Use `$wpdb->prepare()` for dynamic SQL values and whitelist identifiers/order clauses.
- Every REST route needs a meaningful `permission_callback`; avoid `admin-ajax.php` for new REST-fit work.
- Avoid large/volatile autoloaded options, repeated hot option writes, and unbounded queries.
- Preserve backward compatibility for launched/public contracts and real production/client data; do not add shims for abandoned intermediate shapes of unreleased work.
- Use the lowest stable actively maintained non-EOL runtime/tool versions that satisfy WordPress, host/VIP, dependency, and deployment constraints.
- Do not assume filesystem persistence on cloud/VIP-style environments.
- Never expose secret keys, API tokens, private salts, customer PII, or sensitive payloads in public surfaces.

## Validation Ladder

Choose the cheapest reliable gate for the risk: syntax/config, standards/static analysis, runtime probes, unit/integration/E2E tests, CI/CD artifact checks, and scale measurements.

When a tool is missing, use the best available lower-level check and say what was not run.

## Output Expectations

- For reviews: findings first, then open questions/testing gaps.
- For implementation: solution, changed files, validation commands, and remaining risk.
- For brainstorming: options with tradeoffs, recommended direction, and what to prototype or validate.
- For plans: rollout/migration notes, test strategy, backout path, and exact acceptance checks.
