## Quick Start

### Install Globally For Claude Code

Clone this repo and run the installer from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehul0810/wp-expert-codex-skill.git
cd wp-expert-codex-skill

# Install all skills globally.
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh
```

This symlinks the skills into `~/.claude/skills/`, where Claude Code discovers personal/global skills across projects:

```text
~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/shared/references/*.md
```

Install selected skills only:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert wp-contributor
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh content-writer
```

Replace existing non-symlink targets if needed:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh --force
```

Verify Claude can see the skill files on disk:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md && echo "wp-contributor installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md && echo "content-writer installed"
```

After first install, fully restart Claude Code if the skills do not appear immediately. Then run `/help` or explicitly ask Claude Code to use `wp-expert`, `wp-contributor`, or `content-writer`.

### Install Globally For Codex

The same installer also symlinks skills into Codex's global skills directory:

```text
~/.codex/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/shared/references/*.md
```

If `CODEX_HOME` or `CLAUDE_HOME` is set, the installer uses those locations instead of `~/.codex` or `~/.claude`.

## Global Symlink Installer

This repo uses Agent Skills format (`SKILL.md`) so the same skill folders work in both Codex and Claude Code.

What it does:

- Validates each skill folder has compatible frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and naming.
- Symlinks skills to Codex global path: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Symlinks skills to Claude global path: `${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Symlinks shared references to both skill roots as `shared/` so `../shared/references/*.md` resolves consistently from symlinked skill folders.

## Design

The skills are intentionally token-efficient:

- Each `SKILL.md` contains the core operating workflow and reference router.
- Each `references/` directory contains deeper playbooks loaded only when relevant.
- Skill frontmatter descriptions and default prompts are intentionally short because they affect baseline skill-selection context.
- The shared `research-token-discipline.md` reference keeps web/research behavior explicit without duplicating guidance across skills.
- The shared `session-continuity-pr-discipline.md` reference keeps new-chat context recovery and PR base-branch safety explicit across code-oriented skills.
- The shared `project-subagent-routing.md` reference keeps project-level subagent/model routing explicit without bloating hot-path skill instructions.
- The shared `production-dependency-discipline.md` reference keeps Composer/npm production-artifact hygiene consistent across both skills.
- The shared `enterprise-code-quality-gate.md` reference keeps modular, secure, performant, maintainable, test-backed engineering expectations consistent across code-oriented skills.
- The `wp-expert/references/thinking-brainstorming-engineering-discipline.md` reference keeps brainstorming convergence, anti-overengineering, reference budgets, and premium polish stopping rules explicit without bloating the core skill.
- The `wp-expert/references/ux-product-strategy-design-qa.md` reference keeps premium UI/UX strategy, image parity, and design QA explicit without bloating the core skill.
- Focused `wp-expert/references/` playbooks keep plugin product architecture, troubleshooting, conversion engineering, frontend performance, launch readiness, hybrid migration, supportability, analytics, and acceptance criteria loadable only when needed.
- Each `scripts/` directory contains lightweight discovery, validation, and workflow helpers.
- `scripts/skill-token-audit.sh` guards frontmatter, `SKILL.md`, prompt, and reference word budgets so future improvements do not quietly increase token usage.
- `skill-evals/wp-expert-scenarios.md` contains lightweight scenario prompts for checking routing and behavior after skill changes.

See `PLANNING_REPORT.md` for the planning rationale and validation history.
