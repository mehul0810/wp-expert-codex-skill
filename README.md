# WP Expert Codex Skill Pack

This repository contains WordPress and organic-search-focused Codex skills:

- `wp-expert`: principal-grade WordPress engineering for client, product, enterprise, VIP, plugin, theme, block editor, performance, security, and delivery work.
- `wp-contributor`: official WordPress project contribution workflows for Core, Meta, Gutenberg, Trac, GitHub PRs, patches, testing, docs, triage, releases, and contributor communication.
- `content-writer`: organic search content writing for SEO, AEO, GEO, AI Overviews, AI Mode, answer engines, AI tools, briefs, outlines, drafts, audits, and content refreshes.
- `shared/references/research-token-discipline.md`: reusable token-efficient reasoning, repo exploration, web search, validation, and output discipline used by both skills.
- `shared/references/production-dependency-discipline.md`: reusable Composer/npm production dependency hygiene used by both skills.
- `shared/references/enterprise-code-quality-gate.md`: reusable enterprise/WPVIP-grade code creation and review gate for modularity, performance, security, maintainability, observability, and rare-scenario tests.

## wp-expert Coverage

- Plugin development and refactoring.
- Third-party API integrations of any type using official documentation or user-provided specs: REST, GraphQL, SOAP/WSDL, XML-RPC, SDKs, webhooks, OAuth, API keys, rate limits, retries, idempotency, queues, and provider operations.
- Runtime and toolchain version policy: choose the minimum stable actively maintained non-EOL PHP, Node, npm, Composer, database, CI image, and tool versions that satisfy WordPress, host/VIP, dependency, and deployment constraints.
- Changelog and release notes expertise: public/internal changelogs, unreleased feature aggregation, WordPress.org `readme.txt` changelog rules, SemVer impact, security notes, migrations, and developer-facing API notes.
- Release contract and backward compatibility policy: preserve launched/public contracts and real production/client data, but avoid compatibility shims for abandoned intermediate shapes of unreleased features.
- Duplicate code, modularity, and maintainability review: find repeated logic, reduce drift, improve service boundaries, add better tests, and keep refactors simple and reliable.
- Enterprise code-quality gate: generated and reviewed code must be modular, performant, secure, maintainable, testable, and validated against relevant rare/failure scenarios.
- Requirements analysis, PRDs, scope of work, technical breakdowns, Codex-aware estimates, milestones, and delivery buffers.
- WordPress.org Plugin Directory guideline review, block directory eligibility, readme policy, licensing, tracking, and trademark checks.
- WordPress.org release operations: SVN-first verification, `trunk/`, `tags/<version>/`, `assets/`, production `vendor/`, Plugin Check fallbacks, 10up deploy behavior, and GitHub ZIP workflows.
- Theme development, classic themes, block themes, and `theme.json`.
- Style guide, design pattern, and design token translation into WordPress-native primitives, including custom themes and custom child themes on top of existing parent themes.
- Block/FSE architecture decisioning: theme vs plugin ownership, content model, editor ownership, templates, parts, patterns, variations, bindings, custom blocks, dynamic rendering, and Interactivity API.
- Design-to-FSE custom block themes: map designs to `theme.json`, core blocks, patterns, template parts, block styles, and custom blocks only when necessary, without Custom HTML or Shortcode blocks.
- Block Bindings in block themes: map supported core block attributes to dynamic sources before creating custom blocks when native editability is sufficient.
- Ollie block theme and Ollie Pro expertise: Site Editor workflows, child themes, design tokens, Pro pattern library, setup wizard, starter sites, extensions, Menu Designer, WooCommerce layouts, and troubleshooting.
- Blocksy theme and Blocksy Pro expertise: Customizer workflows, Companion plugin, header/footer builders, Content Blocks, Dynamic Data, starter sites, Shop Extra/WooCommerce, Advanced Menu, Pro extensions, licensing, and troubleshooting.
- Block editor compatible code generation and dynamic/static block work.
- React with WordPress enterprise standards: admin/editor apps, frontend interactive blocks, headless boundaries, dependency extraction, REST contracts, `@wordpress/data`, `@wordpress/components`, testing, accessibility, and release artifacts.
- Product-grade UI/UX improvement: visual QA, interaction states, forms, dashboards, responsive polish, and conversion clarity.
- Premium and enterprise visual quality discipline: never settle for generic, inconsistent, or unfinished UI when the project requires a polished brand experience.
- Visual parity regression workflow: deterministic screenshot/state checks across Site Editor, block editor canvas, and frontend surfaces.
- Local HTTPS testing support for custom WordPress development domains that are blocked by the in-app browser, using terminal probes and certificate-error-tolerant browser runners.
- Mobile-first responsive architecture for frontend/customer-facing flows and responsive-safe admin/editor interfaces.
- WordPress Design System support: `@wordpress/components`, design tokens, Figma-to-code mapping, and accessibility.
- Admin UX, settings screens, onboarding, list tables, notices, and frontend UI improvement.
- Performance, caching, database scale, security, privacy, secrets, and PII handling.
- Enterprise architecture, multisite, migrations, async jobs, observability, and rollout/backout planning.
- Observability and incident response: SLOs, VIP Insights, New Relic, logs, slow queries, runbooks, and postmortems.
- Edge caching and CDN architecture: page cache, object cache, static assets, personalization, purge strategy, and stampede protection.
- Load testing and capacity planning for launches, traffic spikes, high-origin-load scenarios, and VIP coordination.
- Enterprise Search and content-scale querying: indexing, search offload, relevance, admin search, and multisite boundaries.
- Security operations and compliance: access governance, penetration testing, audit evidence, privacy, dependency risk, and incident response.
- Deployment and release resilience: built artifacts, feature flags, rollback, smoke checks, cache/search impact, and release communication.
- Content migration and editorial scale: large imports, media migration, redirects, SEO preservation, roles, workflows, and launch cutovers.
- Accessibility, internationalization, localization, RTL, multilingual/global readiness, and WCAG-aligned UI validation.
- WordPress monorepos, multi-plugin/theme packages, shared tooling, generated artifacts, and release engineering.
- Production dependency hygiene for Composer and npm: development-only packages stay in source/CI and out of runtime artifacts.

## Quick Start

### Install Globally For Claude Code

Clone this repo and run the installer from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehul0810/wp-expert-codex-skill.git
cd wp-expert-codex-skill

# Install all skills globally.
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh
```

This symlinks the skills into `~/.claude/skills/`, where Claude Code discovers personal/global skills across projects:

```text
~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
```

Install selected skills only:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert wp-contributor
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh content-writer
```

Replace existing non-symlink targets if needed:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh --force
```

Verify Claude can see the skill files on disk:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md && echo "wp-contributor installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md && echo "content-writer installed"
```

After first install, fully restart Claude Code if the skills do not appear immediately. Then run `/help` or explicitly ask Claude Code to use `wp-expert`, `wp-contributor`, or `content-writer`.

### Install Globally For Codex

The same installer also symlinks skills into Codex's global skills directory:

```text
~/.codex/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
```

If `CODEX_HOME` or `CLAUDE_HOME` is set, the installer uses those locations instead of `~/.codex` or `~/.claude`.

## Global Symlink Installer

This repo uses Agent Skills format (`SKILL.md`) so the same skill folders work in both Codex and Claude Code.

What it does:

- Validates each skill folder has compatible frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and naming.
- Symlinks skills to Codex global path: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Symlinks skills to Claude global path: `${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/<skill-name>`.

## Design

The skills are intentionally token-efficient:

- Each `SKILL.md` contains the core operating workflow and reference router.
- Each `references/` directory contains deeper playbooks loaded only when relevant.
- The shared `research-token-discipline.md` reference keeps web/research behavior explicit without duplicating guidance across skills.
- The shared `production-dependency-discipline.md` reference keeps Composer/npm production-artifact hygiene consistent across both skills.
- The shared `enterprise-code-quality-gate.md` reference keeps modular, secure, performant, maintainable, test-backed engineering expectations consistent across code-oriented skills.
- Each `scripts/` directory contains lightweight discovery, validation, and workflow helpers.

See `PLANNING_REPORT.md` for the planning rationale and validation history.
