# WP Expert Codex Skill

This repository contains the `wordpress-expert` Codex skill for complete, principal-grade WordPress engineering work.

## What It Covers

- Plugin development and refactoring.
- Theme development, classic themes, block themes, and `theme.json`.
- Block editor compatible code generation and dynamic/static block work.
- Admin UX, settings screens, onboarding, list tables, notices, and frontend UI improvement.
- Performance, caching, database scale, security, privacy, secrets, and PII handling.
- Enterprise architecture, multisite, migrations, async jobs, observability, and rollout/backout planning.
- WordPress VIP readiness and high-traffic production constraints.
- Troubleshooting, incident triage, WP-CLI probes, activation checks, and operational debugging.
- Coding standards, linting, static analysis, tests, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, PR workflows, and releases.

## Skill

Install or reference the skill folder:

```text
wordpress-expert/
```

Default invocation:

```text
Use $wordpress-expert to review, implement, debug, harden, or improve a WordPress plugin, theme, block editor, admin UX, CI/CD workflow, or enterprise/VIP codebase.
```

## Design

The skill is intentionally token-efficient:

- `SKILL.md` contains the core operating workflow and reference router.
- `references/` contains deeper playbooks loaded only when relevant.
- `scripts/` contains read-only discovery and validation helpers.

See `PLANNING_REPORT.md` for the planning rationale and validation history.
