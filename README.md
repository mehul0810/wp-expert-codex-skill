## Modular WordPress Expert Coverage

`wp-expert` is intentionally a router. Use the specialist skills directly when the task intent is clear:

- `wp-plugin-expert` for plugin/product implementation, review, debugging, release, and hardening work.
- `wp-theme-expert` for theme, FSE, block editor, design-to-theme, visual parity, and editor/frontend parity work.
- `wp-site-expert` for whole-site, landing page, UX, CRO, SEO/content, analytics, accessibility, and premium site polish work.
- `wp-portfolio-cto` for cross-product portfolio governance, product-thread health, release conflicts, and owner portfolio briefs.
- `wp-product-orchestrator` for one plugin/theme product's backlog, release train, GitHub issue/PR queue, and delegated implementation workflow.
- `loop-steward` for active control-plane PRs that need independent review, bounded repair, or a policy-gated merge decision.
- `behavior-validator` for black-box proof that a WordPress UI, editor flow, API side effect, packaged candidate, or generated artifact behaves as promised without implementation context.

The detailed playbooks remain in `wp-expert/references/` and `shared/references/`; specialist skills load those references only when needed.

## WordPress Expertise Coverage

- Plugin development and refactoring.
- Plugin product architecture: add-ons/pro boundaries, public hooks/filters, extension contracts, feature flags, dependency detection, diagnostics contracts, and upgrade-safe public APIs.
- Plugin debuggability and supportability: Site Health checks, redacted support bundles, log levels, correlation IDs, safe recovery controls, and enterprise support exports.
- Third-party API integrations of any type using official documentation or user-provided specs: REST, GraphQL, SOAP/WSDL, XML-RPC, SDKs, webhooks, OAuth, API keys, rate limits, retries, idempotency, queues, and provider operations.
- Runtime and toolchain version policy: choose the minimum stable actively maintained non-EOL PHP, Node, npm, Composer, database, CI image, and tool versions that satisfy WordPress, host/VIP, dependency, and deployment constraints.
- Changelog and release notes expertise: public/internal changelogs, unreleased feature aggregation, WordPress.org `readme.txt` changelog rules, SemVer impact, security notes, migrations, and developer-facing API notes.
- Release contract and backward compatibility policy: preserve launched/public contracts and real production/client data, but avoid compatibility shims for abandoned intermediate shapes of unreleased features.
- Duplicate code, modularity, and maintainability review: find repeated logic, reduce drift, improve service boundaries, add better tests, and keep refactors simple and reliable.
- Enterprise code-quality gate: generated and reviewed code must be modular, performant, secure, maintainable, testable, and validated against relevant rare/failure scenarios.
- Test coverage discipline: every PR/change makes an explicit test decision, adds or updates coverage when behavior risk warrants it, and flags missing coverage as a concrete review finding.
- Planning drift control and risk-calibrated validation: scope guardrails, stop/ask triggers, and exact user-fed CSS/value changes that can be confirmed by diff without unnecessary visual verification.
- Thinking, brainstorming, and engineering discipline: bounded option generation, anti-overengineering gates, reference-loading budgets, premium polish stopping rules, and token-conscious planning.

## Quick Start

### Install Globally For Claude Code

Clone this repo and run the installer from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehul0810/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills

# Install all skills globally.
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh
```

This symlinks the skills into `~/.claude/skills/`, where Claude Code discovers personal/global skills across projects:

```text
~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-plugin-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-theme-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-site-expert/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-portfolio-cto/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-product-orchestrator/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/loop-steward/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/behavior-validator/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/shared/references/*.md
~/.claude/skills/templates/product-repo/*
```

Install selected skills only:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-plugin-expert wp-theme-expert wp-site-expert
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh wp-expert wp-plugin-expert wp-theme-expert wp-site-expert wp-portfolio-cto wp-product-orchestrator wp-contributor
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh loop-steward
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh behavior-validator
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh content-writer
```

Replace existing non-symlink targets if needed:

```bash
bash scripts/install-global-skill-links.sh --force
```

Verify Claude can see the skill files on disk:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-plugin-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-plugin-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-theme-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-theme-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-site-expert/SKILL.md && echo "wp-site-expert installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-portfolio-cto/SKILL.md && echo "wp-portfolio-cto installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-product-orchestrator/SKILL.md && echo "wp-product-orchestrator installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/loop-steward/SKILL.md && echo "loop-steward installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/behavior-validator/SKILL.md && echo "behavior-validator installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md && echo "wp-contributor installed"
test -f ~/.claude/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md && echo "content-writer installed"
```

After first install, fully restart Claude Code if the skills do not appear immediately. Then run `/help` or explicitly ask Claude Code to use `wp-expert`, `wp-plugin-expert`, `wp-theme-expert`, `wp-site-expert`, `wp-portfolio-cto`, `wp-product-orchestrator`, `loop-steward`, `behavior-validator`, `wp-contributor`, or `content-writer`.

### Install Globally For Codex

The same installer also symlinks skills into Codex's global skills directory:

```text
~/.codex/skills/wp-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-plugin-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-theme-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-site-expert/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-portfolio-cto/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-product-orchestrator/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/loop-steward/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/behavior-validator/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/wp-contributor/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/content-writer/SKILL.md
~/.codex/skills/shared/references/*.md
~/.codex/skills/templates/product-repo/*
```

If `CODEX_HOME` or `CLAUDE_HOME` is set, the installer uses those locations instead of `~/.codex` or `~/.claude`.

## Global Symlink Installer

This repo uses Agent Skills format (`SKILL.md`) so the same skill folders work in both Codex and Claude Code.

What it does:

- Validates each skill folder has compatible frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and naming.
- Symlinks skills to Codex global path: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Symlinks skills to Claude global path: `${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Symlinks shared references to both skill roots as `shared/` so `../shared/references/*.md` resolves consistently from symlinked skill folders.
- Symlinks product repo templates to both skill roots as `templates/` so starter-kit paths are available from global installs.

## Product Repo Autonomy Kit

Install the starter kit into a WordPress plugin/theme repo:

```bash
bash /path/to/agent-skills/scripts/install-product-agent-kit.sh /path/to/product-repo
```

This copies `AGENTS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, and `.codex/prompts/*.md`. Existing files are skipped unless `--force` is passed.

## Design

The skills are intentionally token-efficient:

- Each `SKILL.md` contains the core operating workflow and reference router.
- Each `references/` directory contains deeper playbooks loaded only when relevant.
- Clear plugin, theme, site, product, contribution, and content tasks should trigger the specialist directly; `wp-expert` is only the ambiguous-task router.
- Skill frontmatter descriptions and default prompts are intentionally short because they affect baseline skill-selection context.
- The shared `research-token-discipline.md` reference keeps web/research behavior explicit without duplicating guidance across skills.
- The shared `session-continuity-pr-discipline.md` reference keeps new-chat context recovery and PR base-branch safety explicit across code-oriented skills.
- The shared `project-subagent-routing.md` reference keeps project-level subagent/model routing explicit without bloating hot-path skill instructions.
- The shared product autonomy, queue triage, and live-proof references keep autonomous plugin/theme work explicit without bloating `wp-expert`.
- The shared `production-dependency-discipline.md` reference keeps Composer/npm production-artifact hygiene consistent across both skills.
- The shared `enterprise-code-quality-gate.md` reference keeps modular, secure, performant, maintainable, test-backed engineering expectations consistent across code-oriented skills.
- The `wp-expert/references/thinking-brainstorming-engineering-discipline.md` reference keeps brainstorming convergence, anti-overengineering, reference budgets, and premium polish stopping rules explicit without bloating the core skill.
- The `wp-expert/references/ux-product-strategy-design-qa.md` reference keeps premium UI/UX strategy, image parity, and design QA explicit without bloating the core skill.
- Focused `wp-expert/references/` playbooks keep plugin product architecture, troubleshooting, conversion engineering, frontend performance, launch readiness, hybrid migration, supportability, analytics, and acceptance criteria loadable only when needed.
- Each `scripts/` directory contains lightweight discovery, validation, and workflow helpers.
- `scripts/skill-token-audit.sh` guards frontmatter, `SKILL.md`, prompt, and reference word budgets so future improvements do not quietly increase token usage.
- `scripts/route-budget-audit.sh` guards representative cumulative skill/router/reference paths rather than only individual files.
- `skill-evals/README.md` defines the fresh-agent behavior gate; structural audits never substitute for scenario execution.
- `skill-evals/wp-expert-scenarios.md` contains lightweight scenario prompts for checking routing and behavior after skill changes.

See `PLANNING_REPORT.md` for the planning rationale and validation history.
