# Testing And Validation

Use this to choose validation for Core, Meta, Gutenberg, and related WordPress contribution work.

## Validation Principles

- Prefer existing repository scripts and documented commands.
- Run the narrowest test that proves the contribution, then broader checks when the risk justifies it.
- Record exact commands and outcomes in Trac or PR comments.
- If a tool is unavailable locally, say that clearly and provide the next best evidence.
- Do not mark work as ready until the changed behavior has been confirmed against trunk/main or the required release branch.
- For packaging, release, or deploy changes, verify development-only Composer/npm packages are not present in the production artifact; see `../shared/references/production-dependency-discipline.md`.
- For code changes, use `../shared/references/enterprise-code-quality-gate.md` to select tests for modularity, security, performance, maintainability, and rare/failure scenarios without bloating the patch.

## Core Validation

Discover commands first:

```bash
npm run
composer run-script --list 2>/dev/null || true
```

Common Core checks may include:

```bash
npm run env:start
npm run env:install
npm run build
npm run lint:php
npm run lint:js
npm run test:php
npm run test:js
```

Use exact scripts from the current repository. For targeted PHPUnit tests, inspect the repo test docs and PHPUnit config before choosing class, group, or filter syntax.

Core test evidence should mention:

- Reproduction before fix.
- Test added or updated.
- Targeted PHPUnit/QUnit/Jest command where applicable.
- Manual admin/editor/frontend steps if automated coverage is not enough.
- Multisite, REST, roles/caps, date/time, database, or upgrade tests when affected.
- Rare/failure scenarios covered or intentionally left as residual risk.

## Gutenberg Validation

Discover scripts first with `npm run`. Common validation areas include:

- Package unit tests.
- E2E tests for editor behavior.
- Type checks if present.
- Linting and formatting checks.
- Storybook or visual checks for components.
- Manual editor testing for block behavior and accessibility.

For editor UI changes, include keyboard and screen reader-relevant checks when possible.

## Meta Validation

Meta validation is project-specific. First identify the Meta Handbook/project docs, tracker, source location, local environment, and deployment path.

Typical checks:

- PHP syntax and project linting.
- JS/CSS build and linting if present.
- Local reproduction against the relevant WordPress.org/WordCamp.org/Make/component environment.
- Patch application from the correct root and diff path sanity for Trac attachments.
- Manual browser testing with screenshots/video when public UI, navigation, directory, or handbook behavior changes.
- Cache behavior and invalidation for directory/search/profile changes.
- Privacy checks for profile, event, moderation, application, or attendee data.
- Access and credential checks for SVN, GitHub organization, Slack channel, or admin-only changes; do not claim permissions that are not present.

## Production Dependency Validation

When a contribution affects Composer, npm, package scripts, build output, release ZIPs, deployment branches, or CI artifacts:

- Confirm Composer production artifacts are built with `--no-dev` and do not include `require-dev` packages in `vendor/`.
- Confirm npm production artifacts omit/prune `devDependencies` when `node_modules` is deployed.
- For WordPress plugin/theme releases, confirm `node_modules`, test tooling, lint/static-analysis tools, fixtures, coverage, and local env files are excluded unless the project explicitly requires them.
- Keep lockfiles when they are part of reproducible builds; lockfiles may record dev dependencies without making them production payload.
- Include artifact-inspection evidence in the Trac/PR comment when packaging behavior changes.

## Evidence Format

```text
Testing performed:
- [command]: passed/failed with summary
- [manual check]: passed/failed with environment
- [not run]: reason and risk
```
