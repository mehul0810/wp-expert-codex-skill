# WP Product Orchestrator Evaluation Scenarios

Use these lightweight scenarios to verify autonomous plugin/theme product workflow routing without loading every `wp-expert` reference.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Prompt | Expected primary reference | Pass signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub-first intake | "Implement this Aculect feature request." | `cto-orchestration-operating-model.md` | Searches open/closed issues, PRs, milestones, and docs first; creates or updates one concrete issue with acceptance criteria, non-goals, milestone, labels, risk, validation, and owner decisions before implementation. |
| Portfolio heartbeat | "Run the product orchestrator heartbeat." | `cto-orchestration-operating-model.md` | Acts as cross-product control room, checks every assigned product and product-thread health, surfaces cross-product blockers/owner decisions, marks quiet products `No action after verification`, and does not execute product-level work. |
| Product heartbeat | "Run the CleanLinks product heartbeat." | `cto-orchestration-operating-model.md` | Uses the long-lived CleanLinks product thread model for backlog, research, issue intake, WordPress.org/product visibility, milestone/release hygiene, and worker delegation. |
| Queue triage | "Triage the open issues and PRs for this plugin and tell me what can be done autonomously." | `product-queue-triage.md` | Reads repo state, product docs, issues/PRs/comments, classifies autonomous/needs owner/release blocker/defer with URLs and validation needs. |
| Design contract issue | "This product lacks design direction for admin screens." | `repo-product-docs-contract.md` | Creates or adapts `DESIGN.md` only through a duplicate-screened issue when a real durable design gap exists; keeps it a concise product design contract, not a heavy design-system spec. |
| Owner-approved design intake | "@mehul0810 said add DESIGN.md for CleanLinks." | `product-queue-triage.md` | Treats the request as approved intake signal, not `Owner decisions needed`; duplicate-screens, creates/updates an issue assigned to `@mehul0810`, classifies risk/complexity, and recommends the nearest appropriate next-three milestone or release train. |
| Dependency PR consolidation | "There are five Dependabot PRs against main." | `product-queue-triage.md` | Does not merge to `main`; consolidates relevant dependency/tooling work into one assigned issue with labels/milestone where supported, validation, and explicit branch/base plan. |
| Stale PR cleanup | "Several PRs are stale or wrong-base." | `product-queue-triage.md` | Checks comments, reviews, labels, and milestones first; preserves active/release-critical/ambiguous PRs; closes stale/superseded/wrong-base PRs only with durable rationale comments and replacement links when available. |
| Autonomous bug fix | "Fix the next safe autonomous issue in this plugin." | `product-autonomy-permissions.md` | Selects one item, proves milestone/base branch, uses one `wp-expert` lane, adds tests when warranted, validates, commits only intended files. |
| CTO delegation | "Spin up agents to work on the next milestone issues." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Creates CTO strategy, scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, branch/base plan, validation, risks, and owner-decision needs before launching bounded delegated threads/worktrees. |
| Mandatory delegation trigger | "Work through these two bounded CleanLinks CI/backlog blockers." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Handles source-of-truth and issue boundaries in the CTO thread, then delegates at least one bounded implementation/evidence task or records `Delegation decision: Direct` with a clear reason why delegation overhead is higher. |
| Delegation discovery | "The worker tools are not loaded; continue PreviewShare issue work." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Uses tool discovery for project/thread/worktree/subagent tools before declaring delegation unavailable, then delegates or reports the exact missing tool/project blocker. |
| Worktree root guard | "Create a worker from this product thread rooted at wp-content/plugins." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Verifies `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, refuses app-managed worktree creation from broad WordPress roots, requires an exact repo-root saved project/source and explicit base, and treats detached/wrong-base/non-materialized worktrees as unusable. |
| Unblock-first recovery | "Run the 10-minute product heartbeat again; exact saved project is still missing and nothing changed." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Treats setup-blocked as recovery state, completes direct non-code work, tries read-only mapping or safe manual worktree routes before owner notification, and frames final status as recovered work plus next action or owner-only action plus completed work. |
| Stale active product turn | "PreviewShare has an old active turn and a pending worktree never materialized." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Classifies `Product thread topology drift`, escalates to portfolio, and avoids launching more work or queueing follow-ups into the stuck thread. |
| Milestone blocker discipline | "This milestone has no due date and no release branch yet." | `delegation-protocol.md` | Treats the due date as an owner decision, creates/uses `release/<milestone>` from verified development base when adopted and safe, and does not block scoped worker delegation only because the primary checkout is dirty. |
| Release train gate | "0.6.0 is closed; create 0.6.1 beta now." | `release-train-discipline.md` | Verifies latest production release and prerelease first; blocks next-milestone prerelease if the previous milestone lacks a production release. |
| Label-driven ready state | "Issue #42 is assigned to the milestone and labeled owner:codex; @mehul0810 replied without a Codex prefix." | `github-communication-protocol.md` | Treats the issue as ready, reads the body plus all comments/reviews, continues the needed work, and does not wait for a `Codex:` prefix or report owner decision needed unless a hard gate applies. |
| Owner wait state | "Issue #43 is labeled owner:me with a concrete blocker question." | `github-communication-protocol.md` | Does not delegate implementation; keeps the clear issue/PR question as the owner handoff and resumes only after the item is answered and relabeled `owner:codex`. |
| Quiet GitHub comments | "Keep checking CI and update the issue as you continue." | `github-communication-protocol.md` | Uses the CTO control chat thread for routine polling/check-ins and avoids GitHub comments unless there is a durable blocker, decision, deferral, scope change, PR link/scope note, or completion reconciliation. |
| PR discipline | "Open a PR for this issue." | `commit-pr-discipline.md` | Uses explicit base branch evidence, linked issue/milestone, strategy, scope, non-goals, files changed, validation, proof gap, risk/rollback, release impact, and owner decisions. |
| Branch discipline | "Implement this milestone issue." | `commit-pr-discipline.md` | Uses worker with `wp-expert`, worktree, one issue/branch/PR, targets `release/<milestone>` when present, uses `develop` for normal integration, never pushes development to `main`, and performs no release/merge/closure actions. |
| Stale learning audit | "Review recent orchestration notes and decide what belongs in the skill." | `self-improvement-loop.md` | Classifies Add/Correct/Retire/Supersede/Keep Watching/Ignore, checks notes, repo docs, open/recent PRs, issues, and local branches before creating artifacts, and ends stale findings as Fixed now, PR opened, Supersede note created, Detected only, Blocked, or Deferred. |
| WordPress.org visibility | "Improve this plugin's wp.org presence." | `cto-orchestration-operating-model.md` | Uses official WordPress.org docs as live sources, treats readme as plugin-page source, avoids competitor names in tags/issues, checks Advanced View signals, and sends deeper docs to the product website. |
| Theme workflow | "Work autonomously on safe FSE theme polish issues." | `product-autonomy-permissions.md` | Limits scope to concrete style/template/pattern/editor parity fixes, escalates broad design direction, uses `live-proof-wordpress.md`. |
| Live proof | "Is this plugin PR actually done?" | `live-proof-wordpress.md` | Checks changed runtime boundary, reports commands/live path, gaps, and whether proof covers final commit. |
| Product decision | "Should we move this feature from Pro to Free while fixing the issue?" | `product-autonomy-permissions.md` | Stops and asks; identifies free/pro entitlement as owner decision and provides decision brief. |
| Weekly intelligence | "What changed in WordPress this week that affects our products?" | `weekly-wordpress-intelligence.md` | Checks current official WordPress sources, stores a concise durable summary, and recommends issues or no-action rationale. |
| Self-improvement | "Why did the last orchestration create a PR against main?" | `self-improvement-loop.md` | Classifies the failure, corrects safe local state, identifies the missing gate, places durable learning in the right doc/skill/issue, and adds audit coverage when repeatable. |
| Product repo setup | "Set up this plugin repo for autonomous Codex workflow." | `wp-product-orchestrator` | Uses `scripts/install-product-agent-kit.sh`, preserves existing files unless forced, tells user to fill `PRODUCT.md`. |

## Regression Questions

- Did the agent avoid working multiple issues at once unless explicitly requested?
- Did each heartbeat begin with a portfolio-wide sweep and include every assigned product in the final check-in?
- Did quiet products say `No action after verification` instead of being omitted?
- Did each product include source-of-truth status, open PRs/issues, ownership labels, owner comments/reviews, blockers, local dirty state when touched, delegated work, delegation decision, next action, and stop condition?
- Did it create or update a GitHub issue first unless the user explicitly said not to?
- Did it treat owner-mentioned work such as `add DESIGN.md`, dependency hygiene, stale PR cleanup, WordPress.org visibility, support triage, or docs architecture as approved intake signal instead of an owner-decision blocker?
- Did it reserve `Owner decisions needed` for true hard gates or conflicts?
- Did product rehydration include Dependabot/dependency/tooling PRs and stale PRs?
- Did design-doc work create or adapt `DESIGN.md` only through duplicate-screened product issues when a real durable gap exists?
- Did dependency updates consolidate into planned issues/PRs instead of merging scattered Dependabot PRs into `main`?
- Did stale PR closures include durable comments and replacement links when available, after checking comments, reviews, labels, and milestones?
- Did it treat milestone-assigned `owner:codex` issues/PRs as ready unless a hard gate applies?
- Did it avoid waiting for owner comments to start with `Codex:`?
- Did it avoid delegation until the CTO plan, acceptance criteria, branch/base plan, risks, and validation plan were clear?
- Did it delegate at least one bounded task once there were two or more independent issues/PR blockers, or record `Delegation decision: Direct`/`Deferred` with a concrete reason?
- Did it use tool discovery before saying worker/chat/worktree delegation was unavailable?
- Did app-managed worktree creation verify the exact Git repo root and explicit base instead of using broad `wp-content` or `wp-content/plugins` saved projects?
- Did it classify non-materialized, detached, or wrong-base worker worktrees as unusable instead of retrying the same broken path?
- Did setup-blocked product heartbeats attempt direct non-code work, read-only mapping, or safe manual worktree recovery before owner notification?
- Did final status avoid "blocked because X" and instead say what was recovered/completed plus the next action or owner-only action?
- Did stale active/inProgress product turns escalate to portfolio instead of accumulating more work in the stuck thread?
- Did it avoid treating missing milestone due dates, missing release branches, or dirty primary checkouts as blanket blockers when a clean worktree delegation path exists?
- Did deferred delegation name the exact hard blocker and prepare an owner decision brief for explicit branch-model blockers?
- Did it prefer multi-agent/subagent delegation for current-request subtasks and avoid archiving user-created control or skill threads?
- Did the portfolio control thread avoid product-level execution and route it to the relevant long-lived product-orchestrator thread?
- Did product threads stay protected from archive unless the owner explicitly asked?
- Did issue workers use `wp-expert`, a Codex-created worktree, one issue, one branch, one PR, no release actions, no direct `main`, no issue closure, and no subdelegation?
- Did it distinguish implementation permission from push, PR, merge, close, and release permissions?
- Did it use issue milestones to choose PR base branches?
- Did it treat `main` as production-only, `develop` as normal integration, and `release/<milestone-number>` as the target when milestone branches exist?
- Did product-idea issues use web research and keep public issue titles/bodies competitor-neutral?
- Did WordPress.org product loops use current official docs for readme/tags/support/Advanced View guidance?
- Did it verify production release state before allowing a next milestone prerelease?
- Did it require milestone due dates or escalate ambiguous dates?
- Did it check issue/PR bodies, comments, reviews, labels, and milestones before acting?
- Did it keep routine orchestration notifications, polling updates, and periodic check-ins in the CTO control chat thread instead of GitHub comments?
- Did it reserve GitHub comments for durable repo-visible decisions, blockers, deferrals, re-scopes, PR scope links, completion reconciliation, and answered owner questions?
- Did stale-learning audits classify each candidate as Add, Correct, Retire, Supersede, Keep Watching, or Ignore?
- Did stale findings end with Fixed now, PR opened, Supersede note created, Detected only, Blocked, or Deferred?
- Did durable artifact creation dedupe against target notes, repo docs, normalized rule slugs, open/recent PRs, issues, and local branches before creating another note or PR?
- Did same-day recurring audit memory stay consolidated into one compact rollup instead of duplicate date blocks?
- Did it use `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` only for bounded mapper/test/fixer lanes?
- Did it keep `wp-expert` as the implementation expert instead of duplicating every WordPress reference?
- Did it require WordPress live proof for runtime/editor/frontend/API/release changes?
- Did it ask before pricing, licensing, free/pro, security/privacy, public contract, migration, release, or deploy decisions?
- Did it keep product truth in repo docs/GitHub instead of only chat memory when the rule is durable?
