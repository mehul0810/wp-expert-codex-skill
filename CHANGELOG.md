- **Enterprise Acceptance Criteria Templates**: Added definition-of-done gates for plugin features, themes, REST APIs, migrations, performance fixes, security fixes, and conversion pages.
- **Git Delivery Discipline**: wp-expert now explicitly prefers small focused commits for separable validated changes and pushing all task commits after completion when a remote is configured.

- **Plugin Debuggability And Supportability**: Added Site Health, diagnostics, redacted support bundles, safe logs, correlation IDs, recovery controls, and enterprise support exports.
- **Plugin Product Architecture**: Added guidance for add-on/pro boundaries, extension contracts, public APIs, hooks/filters, feature flags, dependency detection, and upgrade-safe product architecture.
- **Session Continuity And PR Branch Discipline**: Shared guidance for rehydrating repo context in new chats, checking release/hotfix/support branches, explicitly setting PR bases, and verifying PR `baseRefName` before reporting success.
- **Issue Milestone To PR Base Gate**: Shared PR guidance now requires issue milestones and release targets to drive PR base selection, including matching release/hotfix/support branches before defaulting to `main` or `trunk`.
- **Project Subagent Routing Discipline**: Added shared guidance for project-level Codex subagents, skill-level routing, bounded mapper/reviewer/fixer roles, hooks boundaries, and efficient `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` usage.
- **Style Guide And Theme Translation**: wp-expert now includes guidance for translating style guides, design patterns, and design tokens into WordPress-native custom themes, child themes, `theme.json`, patterns, template parts, block styles, and variations.
- **Theme Frontend Performance Quality Gate**: Added Core Web Vitals, fonts, images, responsive media, asset scoping, block CSS bloat, CLS/LCP/INP, and frontend/editor CSS quality guidance.
- **Test Coverage Discipline**: Added wp-expert guidance requiring every PR/change to make an explicit test decision, add or update coverage when behavior risk warrants it, and flag missing coverage as a concrete review finding.
- **Thinking And Anti-Overengineering Discipline**: Added bounded brainstorming, reference/token budgets, anti-overengineering gates, acceptance-criteria calibration, analytics scope control, plugin contract inventory scoping, and premium polish stopping rules.
- **UX Product Strategy And Pixel-Parity Design QA**: Added wp-expert guidance for UX discovery, user journeys, information architecture, UX writing, conversion UX, usability review, design-system governance, premium/enterprise design scoring, and image/screenshot/mockup matching.
- **VIP Enterprise Launch Readiness**: Added enterprise go/no-go matrix, code/data/cache/search/CDN/redirect/observability/rollback/support checks, launch window discipline, and post-launch monitoring guidance.
- **Local HTTPS Testing Workaround**: Added guidance and a helper script for validating custom local HTTPS WordPress domains when the in-app browser blocks self-signed certificates or local proxy routes.
- **Premium Enterprise UI Bar**: wp-expert now explicitly requires polished, brand-aligned, accessible, responsive UI quality for premium and enterprise WordPress work.
- **Performance Profiling And Scale Budgets**: Added deeper wp-expert guidance for baseline measurement, hot-path budgets, query/object-cache profiling, admin/editor speed, Core Web Vitals, async backpressure, and high-traffic acceptance checks.
- **Security Threat Modeling And Review**: Added deeper wp-expert guidance for assets, actors, trust boundaries, REST/admin/upload/webhook/OAuth/MCP entry points, abuse cases, capability/ownership checks, and negative security tests.
- **Enterprise Code Quality Gate**: Shared guidance for wp-expert and wp-contributor requiring modular, performant, secure, maintainable, test-backed code with rare/failure scenario coverage for creation, refactoring, and review.
- **Planning Drift Control**: wp-expert now includes scope guardrails, risk-calibrated validation levels, and exact user-fed CSS/value-change rules that use diff confirmation without unnecessary visual verification.
- **Enterprise WordPress Domain Playbooks**: Added wp-expert references for WooCommerce/commerce, headless/decoupled WordPress, advanced multisite, technical SEO, privacy/data governance, content modeling, disaster recovery, AI/LLM WordPress products, and marketplace/product readiness.
- **Skill Evaluation Scenarios**: Added lightweight wp-expert scenario prompts to verify routing and behavior across exact CSS edits, WooCommerce, headless, multisite, technical SEO, privacy, content modeling, disaster recovery, AI products, and marketplace readiness.
- **Skill Token Budget Audit**: Added a validation guard for frontmatter descriptions, `SKILL.md` bodies, agent default prompts, and reference word budgets.
- **WordPress AI Contribution Guidelines**: wp-contributor now includes Make WordPress AI handbook guidance for AI-assisted contributions, disclosure, GPL compatibility, no-AI-slop quality, tests, documentation, issues, and maintainer expectations.

### Changed

- Shortened skill frontmatter descriptions, agent default prompts, and the `wp-expert` hot-path router to reduce always-loaded token usage.
- Global installer now symlinks `shared/` into Codex and Claude skill roots so shared references resolve consistently from globally linked skills.
- Validation tooling now discovers top-level skill directories dynamically so new skills are covered by reference and script checks.
