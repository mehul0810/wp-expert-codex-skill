# Changelog

All notable changes to the WP Expert skill pack are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Block/FSE Architecture Decisioning**: Dedicated guidance for theme vs plugin ownership, content/data contracts, editor ownership, templates, template parts, patterns, block styles, variations, bindings, custom blocks, dynamic rendering, and Interactivity API.
- **Content Writer Skill**: SEO, AEO, GEO, AI Overviews, AI Mode, answer-engine, and AI-tool-aware content strategy, briefs, drafts, audits, refreshes, schema-aware copy, and source-grounded editorial workflows.
- **Git Delivery Discipline**: wp-expert now explicitly prefers small focused commits for separable validated changes and pushing all task commits after completion when a remote is configured.
- **Style Guide And Theme Translation**: wp-expert now includes guidance for translating style guides, design patterns, and design tokens into WordPress-native custom themes, child themes, `theme.json`, patterns, template parts, block styles, and variations.
- **Local HTTPS Testing Workaround**: Added guidance and a helper script for validating custom local HTTPS WordPress domains when the in-app browser blocks self-signed certificates or local proxy routes.
- **Premium Enterprise UI Bar**: wp-expert now explicitly requires polished, brand-aligned, accessible, responsive UI quality for premium and enterprise WordPress work.

### Changed

- Validation tooling now discovers top-level skill directories dynamically so new skills are covered by reference and script checks.
