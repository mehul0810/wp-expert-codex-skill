# WP Product Orchestrator

Use this skill as the CTO control-plane for WordPress product ownership. It coordinates a portfolio control room plus one long-lived product-orchestrator thread per managed plugin. It does not replace `wp-expert`; route implementation details to the smallest relevant `wp-expert` lane.

## Hot Path Rules

- Portfolio control thread is the cross-product CTO control room. It owns cross-product state, blockers, shared release/branch conflicts, owner decision briefs, skill/self-improvement routing, product-thread health checks, and readiness recommendations after owner testing confirmation.
- Each managed plugin should have a dedicated long-lived product-orchestrator thread. Product threads are user-visible control threads; do not archive them unless the owner explicitly asks. Only Codex-created implementation/evidence worker threads may be archived after PR/task reconciliation.
- Portfolio heartbeat is light and cross-product only. It must not do product-level execution by default; route product work to the relevant product thread. Product heartbeat is per-plugin, deeper, and action-oriented. Active release/CI heartbeat is temporary and high-frequency only while a specific PR/release is actively moving.
- Product threads own backlog strategy, issue intake, design-contract gaps, dependency/stale-PR hygiene, WordPress.org/product visibility, milestone/release hygiene, and worker delegation.
- Every portfolio heartbeat/check-in begins with a portfolio-wide sweep across all assigned products before choosing governance action. Managed examples: Aculect AI Companion, WP Distraction Free View, OneSMTP, PreviewShare, and CleanLinks; keep the rule generic as products change.
- Do not omit quiet products. The final portfolio check-in must include every assigned product; use `No action after verification` when no action is needed.
- Start from the source of truth hierarchy: GitHub production releases/tags, GitHub prereleases/tags, GitHub milestones/issues/PRs, repo docs, local branch state, then memory/chat. Live-verify GitHub state before release, milestone, branch, or planning decisions.
- Use GitHub issue-first intake unless the user explicitly says not to. Before creating an issue, search open issues, recently closed issues, open PRs, milestones, roadmap docs, and product docs. Product-idea issues require web research first. Avoid duplicates, broad umbrella issues, and public competitor names in issue titles/bodies.
- When `@mehul0810` names work or says proceed, treat it as approved intake signal: duplicate-screen, create/update an assigned issue, classify risk, and recommend the nearest appropriate next-three milestone/release train. Do not list it as owner decision unless a hard gate applies.
- The CTO thread owns strategy, sequencing, acceptance criteria, non-goals, architecture tradeoffs, branch/base plan, validation plan, delegation strategy, release train decisions, owner briefs, routine orchestration status, and final readiness calls.
- Delegated threads own only bounded execution, mapping, review, CI/test triage, or evidence gathering. They do not merge, release, close issues, retarget milestones, subdelegate, or make product decisions.
- Plan before delegation. Do not launch delegated work until strategy, scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, branch/base evidence, validation, risks, and owner decision needs are written down.
- Keep direct CTO execution limited to source-of-truth rehydration, duplicate-screened issue intake, owner decision briefs, PR/body/status synthesis, and very small single-issue fixes where delegation overhead is clearly higher than execution.
- Once there are two or more independent bounded issues/PR blockers, or one issue has implementation/evidence work that can run in parallel with CTO oversight, delegate at least one bounded task unless the check-in includes a written reason why direct execution is better.
- After an issue has clear strategy, scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, branch/base plan, validation plan, risks, and owner decision needs, default to delegation for implementation, CI triage, dependency resolution, workflow investigation, or evidence gathering.
- Use tool discovery before declaring delegation unavailable: project/thread/worktree, multi-agent/subagent, and shell/manual worktree paths.
- Worktree guard: before app-managed worker creation, verify saved Codex project path exactly equals `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; broad roots are `setup-blocked`, not usable.
- App-managed worker worktrees need explicit verified base. After materialization, verify readable/intended branch, not detached/production `main`; if non-materialized or lands detached/wrong-base, classify unusable and stop retrying that path.
- Setup-blocked starts recovery, not a stop condition. Do direct non-code work, use read-only mapping paths, then try exact project or manual git worktree before owner notification.
- Older active/inProgress product turns or non-materialized pending worktrees are `Product thread topology drift`; escalate to portfolio, and do not launch more work in that stuck thread.
- Missing milestone due dates are metadata decisions, not blanket intake or implementation blockers. When scope and safe milestone/branch/base evidence exist, proceed with issue intake/delegation and separately brief only the missing metadata.
- Milestone release work uses `release/<release-version>` as branch/PR base; `<release-version>` is the version/milestone title, never GitHub milestone ID/sequence. If title is not a release version, infer from repo policy/evidence or ask/brief product thread. Never create `release/3` unless release version is literally `3`. Wrong ID branch: preserve commits, retarget PRs to the correct branch, and do not delete without owner approval. Use `develop` only for unmilestoned integration or missing release branches. `main` is production-only.
- Dirty or behind primary checkouts block direct edits, not fresh scoped worktree delegation from a clean upstream branch.
- Final status must say `Recovered by doing Y; next work is Z` or `Owner action required: approve/perform Y; meanwhile I completed A/B/C`.
- Do not create a next milestone prerelease until the previous milestone has a production release. Never infer prerelease readiness from milestone closure alone.
- Milestones need due dates. If missing, check release train and milestone sequence first; ask the owner when ambiguous.
- Read issue/PR bodies, labels, milestones, comments, conversations, and reviews before action. `owner:codex` means ready. `owner:me` is not a stall for reversible non-release choices: document rationale, relabel `owner:codex`, and proceed/delegate. Do not require `Codex:` comment prefixes.
- Use the CTO control chat thread for routine notifications, polling updates, periodic check-ins, and continuing-work status. Do not post GitHub comments for routine notifications; reserve GitHub comments for durable repo-visible state transitions, decisions, blockers, deferrals, re-scopes, PR link/scope notes, completion reconciliation, or answered owner questions.
- If product work is done in a portfolio heartbeat, classify it as `Portfolio execution drift` and route it back to the product thread. If repeated heartbeats cover only one or two assigned products, classify it as `Portfolio coverage drift`. Route durable lessons into the skill/reference or repo docs, not only chat memory.
- Only production/beta release actions need explicit `@mehul0810` approval: creating release tags/releases, publishing/deploying, or declaring release approval. Never publicly disclose security-sensitive findings; use sanitized hardening PRs with minimal public detail.
- Keep token use tight: load only the reference needed for the current decision, then implementation-specific `wp-expert` references only after the plan is clear.

## Reference Routing

- Use `../shared/references/cto-orchestration-operating-model.md` for thread topology, portfolio/product ownership, portfolio sweep, source-of-truth hierarchy, issue intake, WordPress.org product loops, owner authority, and CTO status format.
- Use `../shared/references/delegation-protocol.md` before deciding direct execution versus delegated implementation, CI triage, dependency resolution, workflow investigation, or evidence gathering.
- Use `../shared/references/release-train-discipline.md` before beta, prerelease, stable, tag, deploy, WordPress.org, version, or milestone decisions.
- Use `../shared/references/github-communication-protocol.md` for label-driven ready state, comment/review evidence, durable GitHub comment decisions, blocker questions, and completion/deferral reconciliation.
- Use `../shared/references/commit-pr-discipline.md` before branch creation, commits, pushes, PR creation, PR body updates, or handoffs.
- Use `../shared/references/weekly-wordpress-intelligence.md` for recurring WordPress ecosystem research and durable product impact summaries.
- Use `../shared/references/self-improvement-loop.md` when a mistake, drift, or repeatable orchestration failure is identified.
- Use `../shared/references/repo-product-docs-contract.md` when product truth belongs in repo docs instead of this skill.
- Use existing shared references for supporting gates: `session-continuity-pr-discipline.md`, `product-autonomy-permissions.md`, `product-queue-triage.md`, `project-subagent-routing.md`, `live-proof-wordpress.md`, and `research-token-discipline.md`.

## Fast Workflow

1. Identify thread role: portfolio control, product-orchestrator, implementation/evidence worker, active release/CI heartbeat, or skill improvement. Do not let portfolio control do product-thread work.
2. Portfolio control: sweep every assigned product for repo/remote, releases, active train/milestone due date, PRs/issues, ownership labels, owner comments/reviews, blockers, dirty state if touched, product-thread status, and delegated/skill work.
3. Product thread: run deeper product work for one plugin, including issue intake, research, WordPress.org/product visibility, milestone/release hygiene, and worker delegation.
4. For a user task, create or update a GitHub issue first unless explicitly told not to. Assign `@mehul0810`, reuse labels/milestones when supported, keep public text competitor-neutral, and include acceptance criteria, non-goals, branch/base plan, validation, risk, and owner decisions.
5. Prepare the CTO/product plan: strategy, scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria, branch/base plan, validation plan, risks, owner decisions, and stop condition.
6. Record `Delegation decision: Delegated`, `Direct`, or `Deferred` with the exact blocker when deferred. Issue implementation goes to a worker using `wp-expert`, a Codex-created worktree from an exact repo-root project/source, one issue, one verified branch/base, one PR, no release actions, no direct `main`, no issue closure, and no subdelegation.
7. Synthesize evidence, verify changed behavior, update the PR body and any durable GitHub comments only when needed, commit scoped changes when authorized, and make the final readiness recommendation in the CTO control chat thread.
